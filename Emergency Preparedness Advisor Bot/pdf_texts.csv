"11 Steps to Survival  
Canada Emergency Measures Organization  
Department of National Defence  
Blueprint for Survival No. 4  
Make this your handbook for emergencies.  
Keep it in a handy place so that you and your family can refer to it quickly should any emergency threaten.  
Keep other emergency advice such as first aid and artificial respiration instructions, antidotes for poison, emergency telephone 
numbers, in the same place.  
Introduction  
The Canadian Government has joined other peace -minded nations in doing everything possible to reduce world tensions, to assist in the 
settlement of international disputes by peaceful means and to achieve disarmament with such controls as are necessary to preserve the 
security of all nations. However, the awesome threat of a major nuclear war involving North America remains a factor in plans for the 
defence of Canada.  
The nature and scale of a possible nuclear attack on North America, and the extent to which Canada would be involved in such an attack, 
cannot be predicted with accuracy. Our major centres would be at some risk of deliberate attack, random explosions could occur, and there 
would be the certainty of the danger from widespread, radioactive fallout over most of the Country.  
Governments at all levels have made, and are continuing to make, preparations which will reduce the number of casualties, safeguard 
survivors and contribute to the capacity of this nation to survive and recover from such a tragedy. The purpose of this booklet is to assist 
individuals and families in making personal survival plans and preparations to guard themselves against the potential dangers of nuclear 
war. 
Many of the precautions which are recommended will serve a double purpose in that they will save lives in peacetime disasters such as 
flood, tornado, fire, hurricane, blizzard, ice storm or earthquake. Attention has been directed to this important feature throughout the 
various steps. 
All Canadians are urged to read ""11 Steps to Survival"" with care to act on the advice it contains and to keep it handy for emergencies.

The Eleven Steps to Survival  
Governments and communities at all levels are planning for the survival of our Nation in the event of a nuclear war. But the survival of 
individuals also will depend upon the preparation that each person makes. Persons ready to take the right action before and following an 
attack will increase their chances of survival.  
This pamphlet describes what YOU can do before and following a nuclear attack. You can greatly increase your family's and your own 
protection by taking the Eleven Steps to Survival:  lStep 1 : Know the effects of nuclear explosions.  
lStep 2 : Know the facts about radioactive fallout.  
lStep 3 : Know the warning signal and have a battery -powered radio.  
lStep 4 : Know how to take shelter.  
lStep 5 : Have fourteen days emergency supplies.  
lStep 6 : Know how to prevent and fight fires.  
lStep 7 : Know first aid and home nursing.  
lStep 8 : Know emergency cleanliness.  
lStep 9 : Know how to get rid of radioactive dust.  
lStep 10 : Know your municipal plans.  
lStep 11 : Have a plan for your family and yourself.  
Step 1: Know the Effects of Nuclear Explosions  
A nuclear explosion releases vast amounts of energy in three forms:  
1.Light and heat   
2.Blast   
3.Radiation   
The amount of energy released depends upon the size and design of the weapon. A wide range of weapons and delivery systems are 
available to an aggressor and we have no way of knowing what size of explosions might take place in Canada. For illustration purposes, 
we describe in this pamphlet the effects of a 5 -megaton H -bomb equal to the explosive force of five million tons of TNT. Such a bomb could 
substantially damage the largest Canadian city.  
The effects depend upon whether the weapon is exploded high in the air, or on, or near the ground. An air burst usually produces more fire 
and blast -damage than a ground burst which results in a big crater and more radioactive fallout. The effects described below are 
approximate for a 5 -megaton explosion and can only be approximate since effects depend upon a number of conditions such as weather, 
terrain, etc.    
  
Light and Heat  
A blaze of light brighter than the sun is produced by a nuclear explosion. It lasts for about 15 seconds. Temporary blindness and eye injury 
can result from the glare if eyes are not shielded.  
The heat rays from the explosion travel at the speed of light or about 186,000 miles per second. It can start fires up to 20 miles away. Many 
fires are caused when the heat pulse comes through a window to set fire to curtains, paper, clothing and furniture. The heat flash also can 
set fire to the outside of wooden buildings.  
The following are some examples of the predictable effects on unprotected skin of the heat flash of a 5 -megaton weapon exploded on a 
clear day:  
lSkin is badly burned up to 15 miles from the explosion.  
lSkin is blistered up to 18 miles from the explosion.  
lSunburn types of burns up to 23 miles from the explosion.  
Nuclear explosions in the air rather than on the ground are more likely to produce a greater number of serious burns through the heat flash. 
Clothing will give some protection. A shield between you and the light will give protection against burns from the heat flash.  
  
  
Blast  
The blast wave travels more slowly than the heat flash. Several seconds may pass after you have seen the light or felt the heat before the 
blast wave reaches you, depending on the distance you are from the explosion. It is like the time between seeing the flash of lightning and 
hearing the sound of thunder. For example, at ten miles from the centre of an explosion, it would take about 35 seconds for the blast wave 
to reach you. If caught in the open during a nuclear explosion, this time can be used to find some protection from the blast wave.  
You might be injured by being thrown about by the blast; therefore, keep low. The greatest danger is from flying glass, bricks and other 
debris. The blast from a 5 -megaton explosion could injure people as far away as 15 miles.  
  
The kinds of damage that the blast can do to buildings are:  
lComplete destruction of all buildings three miles from the centre of the explosion.  
lDamage beyond repair to buildings three to five miles distant. They would have to be torn down.  
lMajor repairs required to buildings five to 10 miles distant before they could be occupied.  
lLight to moderate damage to buildings 10 to 15 miles distant. They could be occupied during repairs.  
A 20-megaton bomb increases the approximate ranges of damage described above to five, eight, sixteen and twenty -four miles.  
These are approximate distances as the strength of buildings is not uniform. For example, reinforced concrete buildings are more blast 
resistant than wood frame structures. In some areas four miles away from the explosion, concrete buildings might be repairable, while 
wood frame buildings would be completely destroyed. Windows, of course, are very vulnerable and are apt to be blown in as far away as 
25 miles from the explosion.  
Radiation  
A nuclear explosion causes both immediate radiation and residual radiation.  
Immediate radiation is given off at the time of the explosion. It is dangerous only within two or three miles. If you were near the explosion 
without adequate protection and managed to survive the effects of blast and fire, you could still be seriously affected by immediate 
radiation.  
Residual radiation is given off by the radioactive particles left as ""fallout"" after the explosion. The danger from fallout would be so great and 
widespread that it is discussed separately, in >Step 2 .  
Protection against Heat, Blast and Immediate Radiation  
The illustrations below show some of the most probable situations in which you might find yourself at the time of a nuclear attack, and what 
you should do:    
Step 2: Know the Facts About Radioactive Fallout  
If a nuclear weapon is exploded on, or near, the ground, danger from radioactive fallout is greatest. The force of the explosion may make a 
crater up to a mile wide and to a depth of one hundred feet. Millions of tons of pulverized earth, stones, buildings and other materials are 
drawn up into the fireball and become radioactive. Some of the heavier particles spill out around the point of explosion. The rest are sucked 
up into the mushroom cloud.  
This radioactive material is then carried by winds until it settles to earth. This is called ""Fallout"". Under some circumstances you may see 
the fallout; under others you may not.  
The radioactivity it gives off cannot be seen. You can't feel it. You can't smell it.  
But fallout doesn't come out of the sky like a gas and seep into everything. It can best be described as a fine to coarse sand carried by the 
winds. Because the wind direction varies at different heights above the ground, it is not possible to judge from the ground where the fallout 
will settle. It can settle in irregular patterns hundreds of miles from the explosion.  
The fallout from a 5 -megaton explosion could affect seriously an area of 7,000 square miles. If nothing were done to gain protection during 
the period of high radioactivity, there would be a grave danger to life in that area.  
Because fallout is carried so far and covers such a large area, it could be the greatest danger to the largest number of Canadians in a 
nuclear war. If Canada was not hit by nuclear bombs, those exploding in the United States close to our border could result in serious fallout 
in many parts of Canada.  
There are four things which determine the amount of radiation reaching your body from fallout:  
1.The time that has passed since the explosion.  
2.The length of time you are exposed to fallout.  
3.The distance  you are from the fallout.  
4.The shielding  between you and the fallout.  
  
  
Time  
The radioactivity in fallout weakens rapidly in the first hours after an explosion. This weakening is called ""decay"". After seven hours, fallout 
has lost about 90% of the strength it had one hour after the explosion. After two days it has lost 99%; in two weeks 99.9% of its strength is 
gone. Nevertheless, if the radiation at the beginning were high enough, the remaining 0.1% could be dangerous.  
Radiation must be measured by special instruments handled by people trained to use them. But, if you stay in a shelter during the first days 
following an explosion, you escape the strongest radiation. You should stay in the shelter until radiation has been measured and you have 
been told aver the radio that it is safe to come out.   
  
Distance  
The strength of radiation reaching your body is reduced the farther you are from the fallout. Here are some illustrations of the safest place 
to be when you are in various kinds of buildings.  
  
Shielding  
The most effective protection is to place some heavy material between yourself and the fallout. The heavier the material the better the 
protection. Many common materials give excellent protection. The materials and design of the fallout shelter recommended in Blueprint 
for Survival No. 1  will stop penetration of 99% of outside radiation.  
These thicknesses of material will stop 99% of radiation:  
l16 inches of solid brick  
l16 inches of hollow concrete blocks filled with mortar or sand  
l2 feet of packed earth Ä 3 feet if loose  
l5 inches of steel  
l3 inches of lead  
l3 feet of water  
A fallout shelter is the best way to protect your family and yourself against radiation because:   
lIt keeps the radiation at a distance.  
lIt shields you from radiation.  
lThe time spent there is the period when radiation is most intense.  
By providing your family and yourself with a fallout shelter, you are unlikely to suffer serious effects from radioactive fallout.  
  
Personal Danger from Fallout  
Radioactive particles in contact with your skin for a few hours may produce burns. Follow Step 9  to prevent this danger.  
Radioactive particles swallowed in food or water might be harmful. Follow Step 9  to prevent this danger.  
Radioactivity from an area of fallout may produce illness in the unprotected individual after a few days. Follow Step 4  to prevent this 
danger.  
Radiation illness develops slowly. It cannot be spread to other people. Except for temporary nausea shortly after exposure, evidence of 
serious effects from radiation may only appear after an interval of from a few days to three weeks. A combination of loss of hair, loss of 
appetite, increasing paleness, weakness, diarrhoea, sore throat, bleeding gums and easy bruising indicate that the individual requires 
medical attention. Nausea and vomiting may be caused by fright, worry, food poisoning, pregnancy and other common conditions.   
Step 3: Know the Warning Signal and have a Battery -Powered Radio  
All Canadian communities where there is a likely need are provided, or will be provided, with sirens. Other areas should have warning 
arrangements based on local systems such as telephones, horns, bells or factory whistles.  
Warning devices are only attention -getters. Dependent on the size of your municipality, the sirens, bells, telephones, etc., will sound the 
Attack Warning.  
There is one type of siren warning signal in Canada:  
The ATTACK WARNING Signal  
The ATTACK WARNING Signal : A wailing (undulating) tone on the sirens of three to five minutes duration or short blasts on horns or other 
devices repeated as necessary means:  
lAn attack on North America has been detected;  
lWarning of fallout.  
WHEN YOU HEAR THE WARNING SIGNAL, YOU SHOULD TAKE PROTECTIVE ACTION AND LISTEN TO THE RADIO FOR 
INSTRUCTIONS.  
A Radio is Essential  
When the Attack Warning sounds, you must take protective action. Take a battery -powered radio with you. Broadcast advice and 
instruction may help to save your life. If you don't have a portable radio, turn up the volume of your house radio so that it can be heard in 
your shelter. If away from home you are forced to take emergency shelter and are near a radio -equipped vehicle, turn up the volume and 
open all the vehicle's doors or windows.  
The Canadian Emergency Broadcasting System, a network of all Canadian radio and television stations which will be formed when a 
nuclear attack on Canada has been detected, will tell you when and how to take emergency protective action against possible attack and 
shelter against fallout if an attack occurs.    
Before Attack  
If sirens or warning systems signal impending attack, regardless of where you are or what you are doing, you must take the best available 
cover against the blast, heat and light effects of nuclear explosions.  
Emergency broadcast instructions will include the following advice:  
lIf you are at home go to the basement or strongest part of your house or building which offers the best protection. If material is 
handy, improvise blast protection. See Step 4.  
lTake your battery radio with you, or turn up the house radio so that you can hear it while under cover.  
lStay away from windows.  
lLie down and protect yourself from flying glass and falling debris.  
lShield your eyes from the flash of an explosion.  
lIf you are away from home take protective cover immediately.  
lIf you are travelling, stop and take protective cover immediately, or if you are only a few minutes from a safe destination, proceed 
and take protective cover immediately.  
lListen to your radio for further instructions.  
After Attack  
If sirens or warning systems sound following nuclear attacks, the warning may mean another attack or that radioactive fallout is 
approaching your area. You will be advised over the radio.  If the advice concerns fallout, you must take cover against the fallout effects. 
(See Step 4 ).  
Radio broadcasts will identify areas which will be affected by the fallout and give instructions and advice. These might include:  
lLocation of nuclear explosions causing local fallout.  
lInformation about the parts of the country to be affected by fallout.  
lLength of time before fallout is likely to reach specific communities or areas.  
lWays to increase fallout protection.  
lSupplies to take to your fallout shelter.  
lWhether it is safer to stay in your community or area, or to go to other areas.  
lAdvice as to which areas are free of danger.  
lAdvice on when to leave shelters and for how long as danger from radioactive contamination diminishes.  
lRequests for help in rescue operations, such as rescue, firefighting and medical assistance.  
lAdvice on conservation of food, water and fuel.  
lHow to keep warm when power is off and the weather is cold.  
Don't Use The Telephone  
When the sirens sound don't use the telephone. Listen to a radio or television for information. In the event of an Attack Warning telephone 
lines will be required for official use.  
Step 4: Know How to Take Shelter  
It is important to provide your family and yourself with a shelter. But what kind of shelter? This is a decision you must make yourself after 
studying the problem.  
Study your shelter requirements in the same way that you would study accident or fire insurance. Decide upon the degree of protection you 
want for your family and yourself. Shelter is your insurance against something you hope will not happen, but if it does, will give you 
protection.  
Shelters of the type commonly used in Europe during the Second World War would not provide protection against the blast of a nuclear 
explosion. They were designed to withstand short shock pressures lasting something like 1/100th of a second. Shelters designed to 
withstand the pressures created by a nuclear explosion must be able to stand up to pressures lasting as long as 6 seconds. In addition, 
they must be capable of giving the occupants protection against fires outside the shelter as well as against radiation.  
The fallout shelter is designed to give protection against radioactive fallout only. Because most people in Canada probably would not be 
affected by the blast and heat effects of nuclear explosions, protection against fallout is all that is required by them.  
The type of shelter for good protection depends upon the distance it will be from the explosion. Unfortunately, it is not possible to know this 
in advance. That is why each individual must make his own decision when selecting the type of shelter he wishes to have.  
Blueprint for Survival No. 1  gives details of a fallout shelter for the home in which you now live. If you rent the home, the decision to 
construct a shelter must be taken jointly with your landlord.  
Blueprint for Survival No. 2  gives details of a fallout shelter for the new home you may be planning to build.  
Blueprint for Survival No. 6  gives details of blast shelters which may be built outside the home.  
These pamphlets are available from your local Emergency Measures or Civil Defence Organization.    
Improvised Protection Against Blast  
One of the simplest ways to improvise some anti -blast protection is to build a lean -to (bed springs or boards) against a work bench or 
heavy table, preferably in the basement, and pile mattresses on it and at the ends. If the material is readily available it could be built in a 
matter of minutes after the ATTACK WARNING is sounded and could protect you from loose bricks, flying glass, etc.  
If you are in the open and there is a ditch or culvert within easy, quick reach, lie face down in it and cover your face with your arms. Make 
sure this shelter is not too close to buildings which could collapse into it.  
  
""After"" the blast and heat of the explosion, you would have to find other protection against fallout which will come down later. (Don't forget 
your battery -powered radio).  
None of these improvisations is as good as a properly equipped blast shelter, but any single one of them could mean the difference 
between life and death.  
Improvised Protection Against Fallout  
You may not have a fallout shelter when warning of approaching fallout is broadcast. Here are some tips on how to increase your 
protection in a basement. The amount of protection you can build will depend on how much time you have available until fallout arrives.  
lYou can improvise a small emergency shelter by using furniture, doors, dressers, work -bench and other materials.  
lSelect a corner of your basement, if possible away from windows, in which to build your shelter. Remove inside house doors from 
hinges to use as a shelter roof over supports. Supports for the improvised roof can be cabinets, chests of drawers, work -bench, or 
anything which will bear a heavy load. Use the house doors as a roof surface to provide a base for the heavy material you will have 
to place on it. Bricks, concrete blocks, sand -filled drawers or boxes, books or other dense items on the roof will help reduce 
radiation penetration. Around the sides and front of your shelter build walls of dense materials to provide vertical shielding. A small 
cabinet or dirt -filled box as may be used as a crawl -in entrance which can be closed behind you.  
lRemember, the heavier or more dense the material around you, the greater the protection.  
lBlock basement windows with earth, bricks, concrete blocks, books or even bundles of newspaper. In winter, use packed snow.  
lOn the floor above the corner of the you select as your shelter area, pile any heavy objects you may have available, such as 
furniture, trunks filled with clothes, dirt -filled boxes, books, newspapers, or earth from outside.  
lOutside, against above ground walls of the basement around your shelter area heap earth, sand, bricks, concrete blocks or packed 
snow.  
  
  
If your home has no basement or crawl space, build your emergency shelter in that part of the house (centre hall or clothes closet) farthest 
away from outside walls and the roof. Build it as described for houses with basements. On the floor immediately above your shelter area, 
and against surrounding walls, pile up furniture, trunks, dressers, dirtfilled boxes or other heavy material which will reduce radio -active 
penetration into your emergency shelter.  
  
Step 5: Have 14 Days Emergency Supplies  
Nuclear attacks on centres of production, and fallout conditions, may curtail the distribution of available food stocks for several days or 
even weeks following these attacks. Persons who had taken shelter against fallout might be advised to stay in their shelters for as long as 
14 days. Those who had chosen to evacuate larger cities would be dependent largely on the resources available in reception towns. 
Because of these possibilities, it is recommended that every person should have emergency supplies. These supplies should include food, 
water, battery -powered radio, first aid kit, and where necessary, medical supplies as recommended in Step 7 . Heavy clothing would be 
necessary in winter. Extra changes of clothing should be considered particularly stockings and underclothing.  
For those who may choose to evacuate major centres, supplies must be selected carefully because of space limitation in the family car. 
Supplies should be packaged beforehand so that they can quickly be put into the car. See the pamphlet ""Your Emergency Pack"" available 
from your local Emergency Measures or Civil Defence Organization.  
Many of the recommended items are already in your home.  
Whether you choose to evacuate or take shelter locally, you should have a road map with you. You could then relate the information about 
areas under fallout, which you would hear about on the radio, to your actual location. Toys, games, books for your children would help to 
occupy their time if they had to remain in shelter from fallout. Your battery -powered radio will keep you in contact with the outside world.  
The following is a suggested list of items from which your two weeks' supplies should be developed to be in your shelter or handy to it.

containers.  
lChange: Change stored water at least once a month.  
  
Step 6: Know How To Prevent And Fight Fires  
Misinformation about the fire danger from nuclear explosions is widespread and common. For example, some persons believe that the fire -
ball would completely incinerate a city. This is not true.  
The heat from the fire -ball lasts about 15 seconds and would create fires which are no different from the fires you see in peacetime. They 
can be put out with water and extinguishers, and if each survivor were able to put out a small fire quickly, mass fires would not take place.  
The heat flash from the fire -ball entering through windows and doors could set fire to curtains, clothes, furniture and paper. Other fires 
could break out in attics, in backyard trash, on wooden shingles and on the outside of houses built of wood particularly if they are unpainted 
or weathered.  
Knowing how to prevent and fight fires at home and at work reduces the number of peacetime fires. The same knowledge will also reduce 
the number of fires caused by a nuclear explosion.  
But how can you fight fires in the presence of fallout? From 5 to 15 miles from the centre of the explosion, there will be many survivors. 
Fallout will not start coming down for about 30 minutes. During this half hour, survivors should inspect their houses and put out all the small 
fires they can. They must not rely on the fire department to extinguish these fires.  
You should have in your home and place of work, fire extinguishers, or in an emergency, create a water supply for fire fighting in pails, 
bathtubs, washtubs, etc. Don't rely on being able to use the established water supply system.  
Even those who live in areas not attacked may find their fire departments will have to fight major fires elsewhere. Every householder should 
learn how to carry out fire prevention and know how to fight small fires. It may prove of value in peacetime!  
Your local fire authorities are always anxious to advise you on how to fight fires. Attend any emergency fire fighting classes held in your 
area.  
Here are some tips for an emergency:  
lPrepare for emergency by preventing accumulations of trash and rubbish in and around the home. This would include dry leaves 
and grass, lumber, boxes, cardboard cartons, old unused furniture, bales of newspapers, etc. Keep waste and garbage in covered 
containers.  
lThe shaking and twisting of buildings and homes due to blast waves in wartime or earthquakes and explosions in peacetime, may 
break utility inlets at the point they enter the structure. This may allow gas or fuel oil to flow into basements creating a severe 
hazard. Do not smoke, strike a match, or a lighter, to light your way into a darkened basement. Gas or oil vapours may be present 
and a violent explosion and fire may result.  
lTo lessen the danger of fires and explosions follow local instructions about shutting off utility services when the ATTACK WARNING 
sounds.  
lIf you have a coal -burning furnace, or a wood -stove, extinguish it or at least be sure to close all fuel and draft doors.  
lClose curtains shutters or venetian blinds on all windows and remove furniture from window areas.  
  
TO FIGHT AN ORDINARY FIRE:  
lTake away its fuel.  Get the burning material out of your home.  
lTake away its air.  Smother it with a blanket, wet if possible, or a rug.  
lCool it  with water, earth, sand or fire extinguisher.  
GAS, OIL, ELECTRICAL FIRES REQUIRE SPECIAL METHODS:  
lGas fire:  Make sure the gas is shut off and then try to extinguish anything still burning.  
lOil fires:  Make sure the supply is shut off then smother the fire with earth, sand, rugs or other heavy materials ÄDon't use water.  
lElectrical fires:  Make sure the electricity is shut off then put out the fire. Don't use water if the power is still on.  
PROMPT ACTION TO PUT OUT SMALL FIRES IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING A NUCLEAR ATTACK WILL SAVE LIVES.  
Step 7: Know First Aid And Home Nursing  
The acquisition of First Aid and Home Nursing skills prepares individuals to serve effectively in a national emergency. If such an emergency 
occurs, the care of many thousands of injured or seriously ill persons becomes a tremendous task for the organized health services. 
Doctors and nurses may not be readily available to assist you. Thus the importance of First Aid and Home Nursing skills takes on a new 
dimension. The survival of the injured or sick members of your family may become your responsibility.  
The main objectives of training individuals in first aid and home nursing are:  
1.To preserve life  
2.To minimize the effects of injury or illness  
3.To relieve suffering or distress  
4.To provide continuing care and assist in rehabilitation.  
Therefore you must:  
lKnow and practice life -saving first aid.  
lKnow and practice simple home nursing measures.  
First Aid Supplies  
A simple first aid box kept in your shelter or in your evacuation kit should contain:  
l1 bottle mild antiseptic solution (use to clean cuts)  
l5 yards 2 -inch gauze bandage  
l2 triangular bandages (use for slings)  
l12 4"" x 4"" sterile pads (use to cover cuts, wounds and burns)  
l12 assorted individual adhesive dressins (use for minor cuts)  
l2 large dressing pads (shell dressing type) 8"" x 8"" (Available at minimal cost from St. John Ambulance Association)  
l5 yards 1/2 inch adhesive tape  
l9 assorted safety pins  
l1 small bottle toothache drops (for temporary treatment of toothache)  
l1 tube of petroleum jelly  
l1 small bottle aspirin tablets  
l1 thermometer  
l1 small scissors (blunt ended)  
l1 medicine glass  
l1 pair tweezers  
l4 oz baking soda and 8 oz table salt (make a drinking solution by adding 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp baking soda to 1 qt. of water)  
l1 First Aid Manual (St. John Ambulance Association)  
l1 Home Nursing Textbook (St. John Ambulance Association and/or Canadian Red Cross Society)  
l1 packet paper tissues  
NOTE:  individuals requiring special medication such as insulin should maintain at least 100 -days supplies.  
First Aid Hints  
General Rules:   
lKeep calm.  
lKeep the injured person Iying down in a comfortable position, his head level with his body until you determine whether his injuries 
are serious.  
lExamine for stoppage of breathing, serious bleeding or broken bones. These must be treated immediately before any attempt is 
made to move the injured person. Do not be hurried into this unless you are in a situation of extreme danger.  
lKeep him comfortably warm with blankets or other coverings, under and above the patient.  
lNever attempt to give a semi -conscious or unconscious person anything to drink.  
Unconsciousness:   
An unconscious patient lying on his back may be strangled by his own tongue which will tend to fall back and obstruct the airway. All 
unconscious persons should be placed lying half over on their faces, (three -quarter -prone position).  If the patient is breathing quietly and easily and his lips are pink and have no froth on them, breathing is not obstructed.  
If the patient is breathing noisily and with difficulty, if his lips are blue and frothing, or if his chest is sucked inwards when he breathes in, his 
airway is obstructed and needs immediate attention.  
Keep the airway clear by:   
Placing the casualty on his back; supporting his shoulders on a pad of any suitable material available; tilting the head back with one hand 
on the forehead, the other lifting the neck. 
  
If his breathing stops you can breathe for the patient by blowing air into his lungs. Take a deep breath. Pinch the casualty's nostrils. Place 
mouth to mouth tightly. Blow into the casualty's lungs strongly enough to cause his chest to rise. The cycle should be repeated every 3 to 5 
seconds for an adult and a little more frequently for a child. Blow more gently for a child or a baby, but strongly enough to make the chest 
rise.  
Wounds:   
You Must:  
lStop bleeding (haemorrhage)  
lKeep out germs (infection)  
Cover the wound with a clean dressing to keep out dirt and germs. Bandage it on firmly to stop the bleeding. If a wound is bleeding 
profusely, hold it firmly with your hand until you can secure an emergency dressing. Any thick pad of clean, soft, compressible material 
large enough to cover the wound will make a good dressing. Clean handkerchiefs, towels, sanitary pads, tissue handkerchiefs or sheets 
make good emergency dressings.  
  
Burns:   
Cover the burned area with large, thick, dry dressing and bandage it on firmly.  
Encourage the casualty to drink plenty of fluids. A solution of salt and soda is useful to give to casualties with burns and to those who have 
suffered from serious bleeding.  
Broken bones (fractures):   
If a limb is very painful and cannot be used, appears to be bent in the wrong place or the casualty says he heard or felt the bone snap, it is 
likely that a bone is broken.  
Sharp ends of a broken bone may damage important structures such as blood vessels and nerves. A broken limb should be steadied and 
supported to prevent movement of the broken ends before attempting to move the patient.  
If a person's back or neck is so severely injured that he is afraid to move because of pain, or cannot move or feel his limbs, you should 
assume that he has a broken back. He should be moved on a hard, firm stretcher taking great care not to ""jack -knife"" him by picking up his 
feet and shoulders. Improvised stretchers can be made from a door, wide board, window shutter, etc. Fill in the natural hollows of the track 
and neck with padding and support the head on both sides to prevent movement.  
  
DO NOT:  
lPut strong antiseptics into a wound.  
lUse a tourniquet.  
lRemove clothing which is stuck to a burn.  
lBreak any blisters or apply creams or grease to a large burn.  
lGive anything by mouth to a semi -conscious patient, or to a patient with internal abdominal wounds.  
HOME NURSING HINTS  
Before medical or nursing help becomes available you may also encounter infant care problems. emotional problems and persons suffering 
from radiation sickness. What to observe, and what to do for these latter cases, is outlined below.  
Infant Care  
Breast feeding is preferable but, if not possible, then a formula using powdered or evaporated milk should be prepared under clean 
conditions.  
If vomiting or diarrhoea occurs infants and children become dehydrated very quickly. To avoid this happening give frequent sips of boiled 
water.  
If a rash or fever develops, keep others away from the sick child.  
Emotional Problems  
Persons who become emotionally disturbed following a disaster should be treated calmly but firmly. They should be kept in small groups, 
preferably with persons whom they know and encouraged to ""talk out"" their problem. If they are not otherwise injured they should be given 
something to do. It may be necessary to enlist the aid of one other calm person to help subdue the overexcited patient. If a stunned or 
dazed reaction persists over 6 to 8 hours this should be reported to a doctor or nurse immediately one becomes available.  
Radiation Sickness  
The signs and symptoms of this illness are described in Step 2 .  
Treatment includes rest, the provision of whatever nutritional food and drink is available and personal encouragement to get well. Swab the 
mouth gently with mild, warm salt and water if it becomes sore. As these patients are susceptible to infection, keep wounds clean and 
covered with a sterile dressing. Separate these patients from persons with colds, rash or fever.  
Improvised Equipment  
The following suggestions may help you care for your patient when proper equipment is not available.  
lBed: A couch, mattress or any well padded, firm surface; if too low raise on bricks, boxes or wooden blocks.  
lBedding Protection: Old crib pads cut into a convenient size and placed over a waterproof sheeting; or several layers of newspaper 
and heavy brown paper covered with old soft cotton. (Never use thin plastic if patient is a child.)  
lBackrest: A straight -backed chair turned upside down at head of bed and securely tied to bed; a triangular bolster or cushions from 
a chair or chesterfield.  
lBed Cradle: A light wooden box or firm cardboard carton approximately 10 x 12 x 24 inches, with two sides removed; or a hoop 
sawn in half and the two pieces joined together in the centre.  
lPressure Pads: Soft cushion or foam or sponge rubber pads will protect heels, elbows, back of head or any other body pressure 
point.  
lBedpan or Urinal: For bedpan use a padded dish or pan; for urinal any wide -necked bottle or jar.  
lHot Water Bottle: A heated brick wrapped in several layers of newspaper.  
START TRAINING NOW!  
ONE PERSON IN EVERY FAMILY SHOULD BE TRAINED IN FIRST AID AND/OR HOME NURSING.  
Courses in these skills are available in most municipalities from your local St. John Ambulance Association or Canadian Red Cross 
Society.  
REGISTER NOW!  Step 8: Know Emergency Cleanliness  
Your limited supply of water will have to be rationed and used only for essential purposes. If you have enough warning time before the 
arrival of fallout, fill your bathtub, all available buckets and pans with water. And remember that there is an emergency supply in your hot 
water tank. (Don't forget this if in peacetime your water supply has been temporarily disrupted).  
The problems of garbage and human waste disposal can be solved even if fallout keeps you in the shelter. Put all your garbage in tightly 
covered garbage pails. After using your emergency toilet, you should tie human waste in waterproof plastic (polyethylene) bags and place 
them in the garbage pail. Store a 14 -day supply of the plastic bags. After the second day in the shelter, you may risk leaving it for a few 
minutes for essential tasks. Therefore, when your garbage container is filled, move it out of the shelter.  
  
Keep a soft broom in the shelter for tidying it up.  
Remember, personal cleanliness in crowded shelter conditions is important to you and your family.  
If your area is free of fallout but is without sewage services, bury human waste and garbage in the ground. Dig the pit deep enough so that 
the waste will be covered by at least two feet of earth.  
Step 9: Know How To Get Rid Of Radioactive Dust  
In Step 2 , fallout was described as ""sand"". To remove the danger, remove the sand. If you suspect that your clothes have fallout on them, 
remove your outer clothing before you come inside your home and leave it outside. Don't shake these clothes inside the house or shelter. 
You would only scatter the fallout grit and create unnecessary danger to others. If you have water, wash thoroughly, particularly exposed 
skin and hair. But do not scrub your skin as this might rub in the radioactive particles.  
Exposure to fallout does not make you radioactive.   
Even if you are stricken with radiation sickness, this sickness cannot be passed on to others .  
Fallout on your clothing or body would expose you and those close to you to radiation. If you suspect you have been exposed to fallout, 
you will not be a danger to others if you carefully get rid of your outer clothing outside the shelter and wash.  
  
Food and Water  
  
Since most of your food will be in tightly covered containers (cans, bottles, plastic, boxes), it will all be safe to eat or drink if you dust the 
containers. Food, if it is unspoiled and free of grit or dust, may be eaten during the emergency period.  
Be sure to wash fruit and vegetables and peel carefully.  
Water will be safe if it is in covered containers, or if it has come from covered wells, or from undamaged water systems.  
Step 10: Know Your Municipal Plan  
It is important that your local municipality have a plan for a war emergency. And it is just as important that you know that plan.  
Over the past several years, provincial and municipal governments, with the assistance of federal authorities, have been steadily 
developing plans for the protection of the population and the continuity of essential government services in wartime. Most municipalities in 
Canada have emergency plans to deal with both peacetime disasters and a nuclear attack situation. These include the details of how 
welfare, health, police, public utilities, fire and other emergency services will operate.  
Some larger communities have developed plans to assist in the evacuation of those who would choose to leave before an attack or who 
might have to be evacuated as survivors or casualties following an attack. These plans include traffic arrangements to reception centres 
and medical facilities in nearby communities.  
It would be unwise to try and prepare your own family survival plan without first checking to see how it fits in with municipal plans. This 
would be true whether you plan to go to a safer area before attack or remain at home. It is particularly important that you know and 
understand the arrangements to instruct the public about staying in shelter and coming out of shelter when it is safe. Fallout is a health 
hazard which will require countermeasures for personal and family protection including assessment of radiation and advice and instructions 
to those in shelter.  
There must be close understanding and cooperation between the public and municipal authorities responsible for their protection.  
Find out about your municipal emergency plans now and keep well informed about them as they are further developed.  
Step 11: Have A Plan For Your Family And Yourself  
If you know what is contained in the first nine steps, and you know your municipal plan for a war emergency, you should now make your 
personal and family survival plan. The success of your plan will depend on how many of the suggested recommendations you carry out. 
Your chances of survival increase as you carry out each recommendation.  
Thinking about the problems with which you would be faced should nuclear attack be launched against North America is the first important 
step. Blast, light, heat and radioactive fallout are the problems. A workable survival plan will include all of the preparations you can make in 
advance to meet those problems.    
In making that plan, there are certain things you must know:  
When to take protective action  
When the sirens or other warning devices sound and your local broadcast station confirms that an attack on North America has been 
detected it means that you must take protective action immediately. Would you and your family  
lRecognize the Attack Warning signal ?  
lTurn on the radio or television and listen for instructions?  
Where to take shelter  
Deciding where you will take initial protective action and where you and your family will seek shelter from fallout are two basic points which 
you must consider in making your survival plan. Can you answer the following questions about seeking immediate protection and shelter:  
lHave you decided where you will take shelter if you're not at home when the Attack Warning sounds?  
lWill you try to get home?  
lWill your family know what to do if you are not at home?  
lIs there a shelter plan for your children at school?  
lDo you want them to try to get home?  
lDoes everybody in your family know your survival plan?  
In thinking about what you will do or where you would go, you might consider leaving your home to find shelter elsewhere. Before you 
decide to plan on evacuation, consider the following questions:  
lWill protection there be better than in your home?  
lAre there sufficient supplies there?  
lCan you carry emergency supplies for 14 days?  
lDo you know how to get there quickly?  
How to take shelter  
If you don't have a fallout shelter built in your home, study the guide given in Step 4 . It shows how you can improvise emergency home 
protection. Bearing in mind that density and distance between you and the fallout is necessary, try to estimate if there is enough material 
and furniture to build an emergency shelter in your basement or the central part of your house.  
lCan you move it to where it will be needed quickly?  
lWill you have the help you require?  
Based on the lists of emergency supplies suggested in Steps 5, 6, 7 and 8, try to answer the following questions:  
lDo you have them at home?  
lCan you collect and move them to the shelter area quickly?  
lDoes your emergency cooker, lamp, flashlight, radio work?  
lHave you containers for water, garbage, hygiene?  
lDO YOU HAVE A BATTERY RADIO AND SPARE BATTERIES?  
  
There are many other points which you and your family must resolve for a workable survival plan. This booklet provides most of the 
essential information on which to base your plans. Read the Steps again, and, as you review each Step, try to answer the questions which 
apply to your surroundings, your home, your family. Here are a few more which may help:  
lDo I know the recommended fire precautions?  
lDoes anyone in my family know how to fight small fires?  
lCan an emergency supply of water be obtained quickly - for fire fighting? for personal use?  
lAre first aid supplies and special medicines readily available?  
lDoes anyone in my family know how to render fist aid?  
lCan materials for personal hygiene and cleanliness be gathered near the shelter area quickly?  
lDo I know what I must do about radioactive dust?  
lDo I know the emergency plans of my municipality - for public shelters? for planned evacuation routes? for schools, hospitals, 
welfare centres? other special instructions?  
REMEMBER! YOU MUST PLAN FOR:  
lPROTECTIVE ACTION WHEN WARNED OF ATTACK and  
lPROVISION OF SHELTER AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF FALLOUT  
On the basis of what you've read and the questions and answers you've thought about, you should now make your survival plan and start 
making whatever arrangements you can. BUT MAKE SURE THAT ALL MEMBERS OF YOUR FAMILY KNOW YOUR PLAN AND WHAT 
TO DO WHEN THE TIME COMES.  
The best way to arrive at a workable plan which will be remembered by your family is to practice it. If you plan on building an emergency 
shelter, try it now to find out if you have enough material, how much help you'll need, if your proposed area is large enough, and how long it 
will take to build. Locate and practice moving essential supplies, water, clothing, bedding, etc. Practice the essential things you would have 
to do.  
If you plan to move to what you consider a safer location, make a practice run to make sure you know the quickest and safest route, that 
protection is available when you get there, and that you can carry all the supplies you think you'll need.  
A GOOD SURVIVAL PLAN IS A PLAN WHICH YOU KNOW YOU CAN CARRY OUT.  
WRITE DOWN THE IMPORTANT PARTS OF YOUR PLAN.  
List for quick reference the important things to be done in the event of warning. As examples, note when and where all members of your 
family will take shelter at all times; where essential items of food, shelter and other supplies will be obtained; how shelter will be impro vised; 
improvised; what windows must be blocked; if you plan on going to what you consider a safer area, details of the route and supplies you 
will need at your destination.  "

My mom used this remedy on us kids growing up and I
have carried on the tradition with my own kids. It's truly
the best ear infection remedy I've ever tried.
Garlic & Olive oil.
Take two spoons and a fresh clove of garlic. Use the spoons
and smash the garlic between them. Get it nice and mashed
up and juicy. Pour a little cold pressed virgin olive oil into
the spoon over the garlic. Heat over the burner until its
starting to bubble. Let it cool. Using a little baby medicine
syringe pull some up out of the spoon. Put 1 to 2 drops in
the infected ear every couple hours until symptoms resolve.K i d n e y  I n f e c t i o n

I have had several kidney infections over the years, most of
them when I am early postpartum and my body is weaker.
Over the years I have discovered the best remedies for
getting rid of this infection FAST without having to take
antibiotics.
Remedy #1:
Activated charcoal.
Take 4 capsules of activated
charcoal every hour or two until
the symptoms disappear. I take
two more doses even after that
to make sure it's gone. Make
sure to drink a lot of water with
them because charcoal can
make you constipated.
Remedy #2: Herbal tea.
Drink a cup of peppermint and lemon balm tea once or
twice a day. Lemon balm is a natural antiseptic. Peppermint
has antibacterial and antispasmodic properties and it can
help promote urination, which helps flush out the
infection-causing bacteria. Drinking tea also increases your
water intake which flushes out the infection as the charcoal
binds it.Remedy #1: Dmannose.
Take 2 capsules (2500mg total) of dmannose every 2 to 3
hours until symptoms resolve. Make sure to drink lots of
water. The dmannose makes the infection release from the
bladder wall and then you have to drink a lot of water to
flush the infection out.U T I  R e m e d y
Remedy #2: Dried cornsilk.
I harvest corn we grow in our garden, or from other local
organic farms. I then dry it in the dehydrator and store in a
glass mason jar, and make a tea with it for UTIs. Simply
take two teaspoons of this herb and steep in boiling water
for ten to fifteen minutes before drinking. You can drink
this tea up to three times daily.
Remedy #3: Vitamin C.
Take 2 capsules of vitamin C a few times throughout the
day with lots of water. I use an acerola cherry vitamin C
capsule for a natural form of the vitamin.P l a n t a i n  R e m e d y
Method #1: Use it fresh.
The easiest way to use plantain is freshly picked. As soon as one of
your family members gets a wasp sting or spider bite, just head
out to the yard and harvest a couple leaves. Chew it up and stick
right on the bite. You can use a band aid or something to hold it
there for awhile so the herb has time to draw the poison out.There are so many amazing benefits from this so-called ""weed"".
This is one of my favorite things for drawing out poisons. It is the
best remedy of all time for wasp stings, spider bites, etc!
Method #2: Make a tincture.
Of course if you live somewhere that gets cold in the winter this
won't be available all year long to use fresh. So it's a good idea to
make a tincture to have on hand all year.
 
Rip the plantain leaves by hand, or grind them in a mortar and
pestle (wet or dry), and add them to a sterilized jar.
Pour vodka (grain or potato-based) or brandy (fruit-based), or
even apple cider vinegar (raw with the mother) in a 2:1 ratio (2
parts alcohol, 1 part fresh plantain).
 
Label the jar and seal with a tight-fitting lid. Leave it to sit for 4-6
weeks in a dark place. Strain the leaves out and the tincture is
ready to use.
 
You can use as needed once it's done, place topically on the bite or
sting.T o o t h  R e m e d y
I've had several cavities over the last couple years because
of how close my pregnancies were, so I've discovered quite
a few tips for healing and re-mineralizing. (only for minor
cavities, if they have decayed too far down there isn't as
much that can be done naturally)
Remedy #1: Prevention with
vitamins, minerals and diet.
The first and most important step is to work on
replenishing your body and re-mineralizing your teeth. 
 
For awhile I took a mineral supplement, shilajit and vitamin
K daily to re-mineralize. Now I'm healed enough that I just
take minerals and shilajit in my daily multivitamin, and
don't have to add extra.
 
Vitamin A - Supports the proper development of facial
structure and oral mucusol tissues. 
Calcium - Increases bone density.
Vitamin K - Helps move the calcium into the bones and
teeth.
Vitamin D - We need this for our bodies to absorb calcium.  
 
We can get a lot of those vitamins through eating an
ancestral diet. So being really sure to eat organ meats,
fermented cod liver oil, bone broth, bone marrow, raw
milk, raw cheese, fermented foods, grass-fed meat, local bee
pollen, grass-fed butter and other healthy fats. Your tooth
health starts in the gut.
 
A note on the cholesterol myth: don't be afraid of
cholesterol and saturated fats! It is important for
synthesizing Vitamin D from sunlight. Remedy #2: Black
Walnut Extract.
Black walnut extract can be super
helpful for actually healing minor
cavities. 
 
I use two droppers in a little bit of
water. Slosh around for a little while
and then swallow. I do it after each
meal and once before bed.
Remedy #3: Use the right toothpaste.
I would not ever use fluoride toothpaste. Using one with
hydroxyapatite accomplishes the same thing but it's actually
safe to use, unlike fluoride. As well as mixing in other re-
mineralizing things.
 
Here is a list of things I use:
Hydroxyapatite Toothpaste (code WILSON10)
Prebiotic Toothpaste
Re-mineralizing Charcoal Tooth Powder 
Super Re-mineralizing Ozonated Tooth Putty (code

With our world being so full of toxins it's important for
most people to do some form of detoxing, so their bodies
can release all those toxins and not have them sitting in
their bodies causing more harm. But remember, go slow
with detoxing, don't add every single thing at once.
 
Remedy #1: Coffee Enema.
Using a coffee enema is a really great way to help your liver
detox! You need to get special mold-free coffee beans and
an enema kit. I use distilled water and our french press to
brew this. Three Tbsp. for a quart of water, brew for 5
minutes, and then press. Let it cool in a mason jar, then
pour into the enema bag. You want to go slow with this so
you don't get bad cramping. Once it's all inside, set the
timer for 15 minutes and watch something to distract
yourself. Breathe deeply if it's cramping, and don't feel bad
if you can't hold it for the full 15 minutes.
Remedy #2: Infrared Sauna.
Sweating while sitting still (vs. sweating while working out)
is a wonderful way to detox your body, especially your
lymphatic system. It's pulling toxins out through your skin
with your sweat. You experience a productive sweat from
your cells as the infrared waves go deep into your skin, and
heat your core to expel toxins, rather than just sitting in hot,
ambient air that only heats your outer skin.
Remedy #3: Castor Oil Packs.
A castor oil pack will loosen build-up in the digestive tract
and allow you to eliminate excess toxins. I like it especially
for helping the liver to detox.I use some really absorbent cloth, you keep reusing this
cloth each time and throw away when it's too dirty, and I
just keep it in a mason jar in between packs. Soak the cloth
well with castor oil. Put the castor oil soaked cloth on your
abdomen over your liver. Place a waterproof towel or
plastic wrap over top of it. Then place a heating pack on top
of that and turn it on high, or medium if that's too hot for
you. Let it sit for about an hour. Take it off, put the castor
oil cloth in a jar for next time, and wipe off your stomach
where all the oil is. You can do this a few times a week or as
infrequently as once or twice a month.
 
Remedy #4: Milk Thistle.
I use milk thistle capsules whenever I am doing a detox to
help my liver expel more toxins and also protect it from
any damage. It can help the detox be more gentle on your
body but also more effective. Take 1 capsule about 30
minutes before starting one of your detox regimens. K i d n e y  S t o n e s
I had a bout of kidney stones after my second baby was
born - another one of those things that made me realize the
importance of taking extra good care of my body in
pregnancy and not stressing my body out so much.
 
Remedy #1: Chanca Piedra.
This herbal tincture helps break up stones. I took 1 dropper
in a little water, 3 times a day until the stones passed.
Remedy #2: Lemon Juice.
Lemon juice is something that can help shrink the stones,
making them easier to pass. Add a couple ounces of lemon
juice to your water that you drink through the day. The
more you can tolerate the better.
Remedy #3: Lots of Water.
Water is super important for passing stones. It helps flush
them out and being hydrated also helps prevent more
stones from forming.
Remedy #4: Super Phosphozyme
Supplement.
These capsules are very effective at dissolving stones. When
I had gallbladder stones I took 4 a day for 3 days. When I
had kidney stones I took 3 a day for 3 days and then down
to 1 a day for another three days. It is very helpful to work
with a muscle tester when taking this, because you don't
want to take too much or for too long. Take 2 hours after
food and 1 hour before food because it rids the stomach of

Years ago I had a super stubborn wart on one of my fingers
that refused to leave no matter what I tried Until I learned
about this remedy somewhere and tried it, and it finally
made that horrible thing disappear for good!
 
Thuja Essential Oil & Ozonated
Olive Oil.
Place a drop of Thuja Essential Oil on the wart, then smear
a very small amount of the Ozonated Olive Oil over that.
Then put a bandaid over that. You don't want it open to the
air, that seems to make it grow back. Keeping it covered and
moist is going to make those things penetrate deeper into
the wart to kill it. Repeat the process once a day until the
wart is gone.
 
Every now and then, as the top of the wart dies, you can use
a clipper to cut off the top, that lets you get even deeper,
faster with the remedy.
 
This can take a long time, so don't give up hope! I also
recommend doing it for another few weeks after you think
it's gone.

Remedy #1: Leefy Prana.
Leefy Prana is a tincture we use for it's amazing anti-
inflammatory properties. It has organic turmeric root,
organic ginger root, and organic black pepper fruit. Using
any of those separately or in another from can help too.
Relieving inflammation can help with minor headaches as
well as migraines.
Remedy #2: Kali Phosphoricum.
This is a homeopathic remedy that relieves tension
headaches. I dissolve 5 pellets under my tongue up to 3
times during a day.
Remedy #3: Peppermint Essential
Oil.
Peppermint essential oil has a very cooling and soothing
effect. I drop some on my fingers and carefully rub it on
my temples, forehead, and the back of my neck. Be careful
not to get it near your eyes.
Remedy #4: Hydrate.
Sometimes headaches are just because we aren't hydrated
well at a cellular level. Just chugging plain water won't help
all the time, so adding a little pinch of mineral salt to your
water actually helps make sure your cells are being
hydrated and the water isn't just flushing your minerals
away.D i a r r h e a

These are some remedies for temporary diarrhea. If you
are having on-going diarrhea it is time to look for a deeper
root cause. Gut imbalance, colon issues, microbiome, there
are so many things that could cause it. So I'd recommend
going to see a naturopath and/or kinesiologist.
 
Remedy #1: Activated Charcoal.
Activated charcoal is actually something that can make you
constipated if you're taking it for an infection and you don't
drink enough water with it. So it can be helpful to
temporarily relieve the symptoms of diarrhea.
Remedy #2: Podophyllum
Peltatum.
This is a homeopathic that relieves diarrhea with intestinal
growling and pain. Take 5 pellets, hold under the tongue
until they dissolve, up to 3 times a day.
Remedy #3: Cinchona Officinalis.
This is a homeopathic that relieves diarrhea with gas and
bloating. Take 5 pellets, hold under the tongue until they
dissolve, up to 3 times a day.
Remedy #4: Probiotic Yogurt (or
Kefir).
Yogurt contains bifidobacterium and lactobacillus
acidophilus, which are useful for reducing diarrhea. Also,
these good bacteria are high in lactic acid, and can be really
effective for treating diarrhea.C o n s t i p a t i o n
R e m e d i e s
Remedy #1: Prunes or Prune Juice.
Eat a few prunes or drink a cup of prune juice to loosen
things up. This remedy is my favorite for kiddos because
they don't mind drinking the juice.
Remedy #2: Magnesium Citrate.
This form of magnesium can have a laxative effect so that's
why I don't like it for general magnesium intake, but it is
very effective at loosening up stools, so I keep a bottle on
hand just incase.G e n e r a l  C o l d  &
F l u  S u p p o r t
Remedy #1: Elderberry Syrup.
Take extra of your elderberry syrup. Recipe on page 6.
Remedy #2: Vitamin C.
We take the real food vitamin C: Acerola powder when we
are sick to help our immune systems start to fight off the
cold. It is a powerful anti-oxidant and it also helps increase
the absorption of the nutrients taken in through our food.
So it helps give our bodies more defenses during a sickness.
Remedy #3: Sublingual Sprays.
I like to use sublingual sprays when we are sick as well.
They are easy for kids to take and can be really helpful for
anyone with gut issues because the vitamins enter the
bloodstream in minutes and bypass the gut. I have on hand
C, D, and B sprays. The C spray has zinc, acerola (vit C),
echinacea, and elderberry, so it's a wonderful immune
support to have on hand!! Link on page 4.
Remedy #4: Extra Hydration and
Bone Broth.
It's really important to make sure you are staying hydrated
while sick. Drink mineral water to re-hydrate your cells. We
like to have homemade bone broth on hand for sipping on
also. It is hydrating and it's also giving your body protein,
minerals and other nutrients important for healing.Remedy #5: Wet Sock Treatment.
This may sound like a strange one, but using this treatment
helps increase circulation which stimulates the immune
system and decreases congestion in the upper respiratory
passages, head and throat. Start right at the onset of an
illness and repeat for 3 nights in a row.
 
First take a nice warm bath, then get ready for bed. Soak
some cotton socks in ice water, then ring out and put them
on your feet. Layer a nice thick dry pair of wool socks on
top of the wet cotton socks. Go to sleep and allow it to
increase your circulation and work it's magic.
Remedy #6: Lower Intake of
Processed Foods and Sugars.
Eating processed sugary foods during a sickness, like store-
bought ice cream, can feed the bad bacteria and make it
harder for your body to heal. Eat lots of grassfed meat, lacto
fermented foods, bone broth, bone marrow, raw dairy, to
give yourself the proper nutritional support.
Remedy #7: Argentyn 23.
This is a Professional Bio-Active Silver Hydrosol. It has
positively charged silver ions and is very effective for
immune system support. For short term use during a
sickness, take 1 tsp 5 to 7 times a day (only 1/2 tsp for
children).Remedy #8: Boiron
Oscillococcinum.
This is a homeopathic remedy for flu symptoms for the
whole family. Adults and children 2 years an older dissolve
entire contents of one tube in the mouth every 6 hours, up
to 3 times a day.
Remedy #9: Bee Propolis.
Bee propolis spray supports your immune system with
antioxidants, vitamin C, zinc, iron, B vitamins, and over
300 other beneficial compounds. It naturally contains
flavonoids and polyphenols that fight free radicals and
combat oxidative stress. It's also amazing for soothing a
sore throat.F e v e r s
My general rule is to just let fevers be if I can. It is
your body's natural and effective way of killing
whatever virus is attacking. But if they get too high
(over 102F) then I have a few remedies on hand to
help.
 
The first line of defense is always eating
nourishing foods and staying hydrated.
 
Remedy #1: Boiron Aconitum
Napellus.
This is a homeopathic remedy for high fevers. Dissolve 5
pellets under the tongue 3 times a day until symptoms
resolve.
Remedy #2: Chiropractic
Adjustments.
During a fever and illness, a chiropractic adjustment can
remove some of the stress and interference the central
nervous system may be experiencing by getting the spine
aligned. When the spine is aligned, the body should be
much more efficient and stronger.
Remedy #3: Dr. Talbot's
Homeopathic Pain + Fever Relief
Liquid Medicine.
I use this homeopathic liquid for my kiddos when they
have a high fever. I use this instead of tylenol. Tylenol we
have on hand only for dire emergencies. Remedy #1: Eat Right Away.
I find personally that the nausea gets much worse when I let
myself get hungry. So eating a little something right away
in the morning really helps. Even if it's just a little cup of
raw milk.M o r n i n g
S i c k n e s s
Remedy #2: Magnesium.
Sometimes pregnancy sickness can be made worse by
magnesium deficiency. So taking a magnesium supplement
is helpful. Either a topical magnesium oil spray like from
Ancient Minerals. Or a magnesium glycinate capsule.
Remedy #3:
Ginger and
Peppermint.
Sipping on either
ginger or
peppermint tea
through the day is
super helpful. Both
of those things relive
nausea very
effectively.Remedies for Varicose Veins
 
Some things that can help prevent varicose veins or
improve current ones are: 
 
Applying Cypress Infused Oil, Vitamin E, Magnesium Oil
and Witch Hazel topically on the varicose veins.
 
Apply a fresh poultice of comfrey, yarrow, and mullein.V a r i c o s e  V e i n s
Take medical grade liquid
Collagen, get adequate
Copper intake, take
Quercetin, Vitamin K,
Vitamin E, and
Magnesium.
 
Drink nettle and parsley
tea.
 
Get consistent exercise,
including brisk walking.
Leg inversions can help as
well, do inverted yoga
poses as well. 
 
Remove seed oils.
 
Avoid crossing your legs,
wearing knee length socks,
tight clothing, or high
heeled shoes, and straining
too hard on the toilet.Thank you for reading!

Recovering
from Disaster
Recovering from Disaster 5.0      Are You Ready?
180Health and Safety 
Guidelines
Recovering from a disaster is usually a gradual process.  Safet y is a primary issue, as 
are mental and physical well-being.  If assistance is available , knowing how to ac-
cess it makes the process faster and less stressful.  This sect ion offers some general 
advice on steps to take after disaster strikes in order to begi n getting your home, 
your community , and your life back to normal.
Your ﬁ  rst concern after a disaster is your family’s health and safet y .  You need to 
consider possible safety issues and monitor family health and w ell-being.  
Aiding the Injured
Check for injuries.  Do not attempt to move seriously injured p ersons unless they 
are in immediate danger of death or further injury .  If you mus t move an uncon-
scious person, ﬁ  rst stabilize the neck and back, then call for help immediatel y.
• If the victim is not breathing, carefully position the victim  for artiﬁ  cial respi-
ration, clear the airway , and commence mouth-to-mouth resuscita tion.
• Maintain body temperature with blankets.  Be sure the victim does not be-
come overheated.
• Never try to feed liquids to an unconscious person.
Health
• Be aware of exhaustion.  Don’t try to do too much at once.  S et priorities and 
pace yourself.  Get enough rest.
• Drink plenty of clean water.  
• Eat well.• Wear sturdy work boots and gloves. • Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and clean water often wh en working 
in debris.
Safety Issues  
• Be aware of new safety issues created by the disaster.  Watch  for washed out 
roads, contaminated buildings, contaminated water, gas leaks, b roken glass, 
damaged electrical wiring, and slippery ﬂ  oors.
• Inform local authorities about health and safety issues, incl uding chemical 
spills, downed power lines, washed out roads, smoldering insula tion, and 
dead animals. Recovering from Disaster 5.0 Are You Ready?   
181
Recovering
from DisasterReturning Home
Returning home can be both physically and mentally challenging.   Above all, use 
caution. 
General tips: 
• Keep a battery-powered radio with you so you can listen for em ergency up-
dates and news reports.
• Use a battery-powered ﬂ ash light to inspect a damaged home.  
Note:  The ﬂ ashlight should be turned on outside before entering —the bat-
tery may produce a spark that could ignite leaking gas, if pres ent. 
• Watch out for animals, especially poisonous snakes.  Use a sti ck to poke 
through debris.
• Use the phone only to report life-threatening emergencies.
• Stay off the streets.  If you must go out, watch for fallen ob jects; downed elec-
trical wires; and weakened walls, bridges, roads, and sidewalks .
Before You Enter Your Yome
Walk carefully around the outside and check for loose power lin es, gas leaks, and 
structural damage.  If you have any doubts about safety , have y our residence in-
spected by a quali ﬁ ed building inspector or structural engineer before entering.
Do not enter if:
• You smell gas. 
• Floodwaters remain around the building.
• Your home was damaged by ﬁ re and the authorities have not declared it safe.
Going Inside Your Home
When you go inside your home, there are certain things you shou ld and should 
not do. Enter the home carefully and check for damage.  Be awar e of loose boards 
and slippery ﬂ oors.  The following items are other things to check inside yo ur 
home:
Recovering from Disaster 5.0      Are You Ready?
182• Natural gas.  If you smell gas or hear a hissing or blowing sound, open a 
window and leave immediately .  Turn off the main gas valve from  the outside, 
if you can.  Call the gas company from a neighbor ’s residence.  If you shut off 
the gas supply at the main valve, you will need a professional to turn it back 
on.  Do not smoke or use oil, gas lanterns, candles, or torches  for lighting 
inside a damaged home until you are sure there is no leaking ga s or other 
ﬂ ammable materials present.  
• Sparks, broken or frayed wires.  Check the electrical system unless you are 
wet, standing in water, or unsure of your safety .  If possible,  turn off the elec-
tricity at the main fuse box or circuit breaker.  If the situat ion is unsafe, leave 
the building and call for help.  Do not turn on the lights unti l you are sure 
they’re safe to use.  You may want to have an electrician inspect yo ur wiring.
• Roof, foundation, and chimney cracks. If it looks like the building may col-
lapse, leave immediately .  
• Appliances.  If appliances are wet, turn off the electricity at the main fu se 
box or circuit breaker.  Then, unplug appliances and let them d ry out.  Have 
appliances checked by a professional before using them again.  Also, have the 
electrical system checked by an electrician before turning the power back on.
• Water and sewage systems.  If pipes are damaged, turn off the main water 
valve.  Check with local authorities before using any water; th e water could be 
contaminated.  Pump out wells and have the water tested by auth orities before 
drinking.  Do not ﬂ ush toilets until you know that sewage lines are intact.
• Food and other supplies.  Throw out all food and other supplies that you sus-
pect may have become contaminated or come in to contact with ﬂ oodwater.
• Y our basement.  If your basement has ﬂ ooded, pump it out gradually (about 
one third of the water per day) to avoid damage.  The walls may  collapse and 
the ﬂ oor may buckle if the basement is pumped out while the surroun ding 
ground is still waterlogged.
• Open cabinets.  Be alert for objects that may fall.
• Clean up household chemical spills.  Disinfect items that may have been con-
taminated by raw sewage, bacteria, or chemicals.  Also clean sa lvageable items. 
• Call your insurance agent.   Take pictures of damages.  Keep good records of 
repair and cleaning costs.

Recovering
from DisasterBeing Wary of Wildlife and 
Other Animals
Disaster and life threatening situations will exacerbate the un predictable nature of 
wild animals.  To protect yourself and your family , learn how t o deal with wildlife.
Guidelines  
• Do not approach or attempt to help an injured or stranded anim al. Call your 
local animal control of ﬁ ce or wildlife resource of ﬁ ce. 
• Do not corner wild animals or try to rescue them.  Wild animal s will likely 
feel threatened and may endanger themselves by dashing off into  ﬂ oodwaters, 
ﬁ re, and so forth.
• Do not approach wild animals that have taken refuge in your ho me.  Wild 
animals such as snakes, opossums, and raccoons often seek refug e from 
ﬂ oodwaters on upper levels of homes and have been known to rema in after 
water recedes.  If you encounter animals in this situation, ope n a window or 
provide another escape route and the animal will likely leave o n its own.  Do 
not attempt to capture or handle the animal.  Should the animal  stay , call your 
local animal control of ﬁ ce or wildlife resource of ﬁ ce.
• Do not attempt to move a dead animal. Animal carcasses can pre sent serious 
health risks.  Contact your local emergency management of ﬁ ce or health de-
partment for help and instructions.
• If bitten by an animal, seek immediate medical attention.
Seeking Disaster Assistance
Throughout the recovery period, it is important to monitor loca l radio or televi-
sion reports and other media sources for information about wher e to get emergen-
cy housing, food, ﬁ rst aid, clothing, and ﬁ nancial assistance.  The following section 
provides general information about the kinds of assistance that  may be available.
Recovering from Disaster 5.0      Are You Ready?
184Direct Assistance Direct assistance to individuals and families may come from any  number of organi-
zations, including: 
• American Red Cross.
• Salvation Army .
• Other volunteer organization.  
These organizations provide food, shelter, supplies and assist in clean-up efforts.
The Federal Role
In the most severe disasters, the federal government is also ca lled in to help indi-
viduals and families with temporary housing, counseling (for po st-disaster trau-
ma), low-interest loans and grants, and other assistance.  The federal government 
also has programs that help small businesses and farmers.
Most federal assistance becomes available when the President of  the United States 
declares a “Major Disaster ” for the affected area at the request of a state governor.  
FEMA will provide information through the media and community o utreach about 
federal assistance and how to apply .  
Coping with Disaster
The emotional toll that disaster brings can sometimes be even m ore devastating 
than the ﬁ nancial strains of damage and loss of home, business, or perso nal prop-
erty .  
Understand Disaster Events
•  Everyone who sees or experiences a disaster is affected by it  in some way .  
•  It is normal to feel anxious about your own safety and that o f your family and 
close friends.  
•  Profound sadness, grief, and anger are normal reactions to an  abnormal event. 
•  Acknowledging your feelings helps you recover. 
•  Focusing on your strengths and abilities helps you heal. 
•  Accepting help from community programs and resources is healt hy. 
•  Everyone has different needs and different ways of coping. 
•  It is common to want to strike back at people who have caused  great pain. 
Children and older adults are of special concern in the afterma th of disasters.  Even 
individuals who experience a disaster “second hand ” through exposure to extensive 
media coverage can be affected.  Contact local faith-based organizations, voluntary agencies, or  professional coun-
selors for counseling.  Additionally , FEMA and state and local governments of the 
affected area may provide crisis counseling assistance. Recovering from Disaster 5.0 Are You Ready?

even though it may be dif ﬁ cult. 
• Seek help from professional counselors who deal with post-disa ster stress.
• Do not hold yourself responsible for the disastrous event or b e frustrated be-
cause you feel you cannot help directly in the rescue work. 
• Take steps to promote your own physical and emotional healing by healthy 
eating, rest, exercise, relaxation, and meditation. 
• Maintain a normal family and daily routine, limiting demanding  responsibili-
ties on yourself and your family . 
• Spend time with family and friends. 
• Participate in memorials. Recovering from Disaster 5.0      Are You Ready?

• Ensure you are ready for future events by restocking your disa ster supplies kits 
and updating your family disaster plan.  Doing these positive a ctions can be 
comforting.
Helping Children Cope 
with Disaster 
Disasters can leave children feeling frightened, confused, and insecure.  Whether a 
child has personally experienced trauma, has merely seen the ev ent on television, 
or has heard it discussed by adults, it is important for parent s and teachers to be 
informed and ready to help if reactions to stress begin to occu r.
Children may respond to disaster by demonstrating fears, sadnes s, or behavioral 
problems.  Younger children may return to earlier behavior patt erns, such as bed-
wetting, sleep problems, and separation anxiety .  Older childre n may also display 
anger, aggression, school problems, or withdrawal.  Some childr en who have only 
indirect contact with the disaster but witness it on television  may develop distress.
Who is at Risk? 
For many children, reactions to disasters are brief and represe nt normal reac-
tions to “abnormal events. ”  A smaller number of children can be at risk for more 
enduring psychological distress as a function of three major ri sk factors:
• Direct exposure to the disaster, such as being evacuated, obse rving injuries 
or death of others, or experiencing injury along with fearing o ne’s life is in 
danger
• Loss/grief: This relates to the death or serious injury of fam ily or friends
• On-going stress from the secondary effects of disaster, such a s temporarily 
living elsewhere, loss of friends and social networks, loss of personal property , 
parental unemployment, and costs incurred during recovery to re turn the 
family to pre-disaster life and living conditions. 
What Creates Vulnerabilities in Children?
In most cases, depending on the risk factors above, distressing  responses are 
temporary .  In the absence of severe threat to life, injury , lo ss of loved ones, or 
secondary problems such as loss of home, moves, etc., symptoms usually dimin-
ish over time.  For those that were directly exposed to the dis aster, reminders of 
the disaster such as high winds, smoke, cloudy skies, sirens, o r other reminders 
of the disaster may cause upsetting feelings to return.  Having  a prior history of 
some type of traumatic event or severe stress may contribute to  these feelings.

187
Recovering
from DisasterChildren ’s coping with disaster or emergencies is often tied to the way parents 
cope. They can detect adults ’ fears and sadness.  Parents and adults can make 
disasters less traumatic for children by taking steps to manage  their own feelings 
and plans for coping.  Parents are almost always the best sourc e of support for 
children in disasters.  One way to establish a sense of control  and to build con ﬁ -
dence in children before a disaster is to engage and involve th em in preparing a 
family disaster plan.  After a disaster, children can contribut e to a family recovery 
plan.   
A Child ’s Reaction to Disaster by Age 
Below are common reactions in children after a disaster or trau matic event.
Birth through 2 years.  When children are pre-verbal and experience a trauma, 
they do not have the words to describe the event or their feeli ngs.  However, they 
can retain memories of particular sights, sounds, or smells.  I nfants may react 
to trauma by being irritable, crying more than usual, or wantin g to be held and 
cuddled.  The biggest in ﬂ uence on children of this age is how their parents cope.  
As children get older, their play may involve acting out elemen ts of the traumatic 
event that occurred several years in the past and was seemingly  forgotten.
Preschool —3 through 6 years.  Preschool children often feel helpless and pow-
erless in the face of an overwhelming event.  Because of their age and small size, 
they lack the ability to protect themselves or others.  As a re sult, they feel intense 
fear and insecurity about being separated from caregivers.  Pre schoolers cannot 
grasp the concept of permanent loss.  They can see consequences  as being revers-
ible or permanent.  In the weeks following a traumatic event, p reschoolers ’ play 
activities may reenact the incident or the disaster over and ov er again.
School age —7 through 10 years.  The school-age child has the ability to un-
derstand the permanence of loss.  Some children become intensel y preoccupied 
with the details of a traumatic event and want to talk about it  continually .  This 
preoccupation can interfere with the child ’s concentration at school and academ-
ic performance may decline.  At school, children may hear inacc urate informa-
tion from peers.  They may display a wide range of reactions —sadness, general-
ized fear, or speci ﬁ c fears of the disaster happening again, guilt over action or 
inaction during the disaster, anger that the event was not prev ented, or fantasies 
of playing rescuer.
Pre-adolescence to adolescence —11 through 18 years .  As children grow 
older, they develop a more sophisticated understanding of the d isaster event. 
Their responses are more similar to adults.  Teenagers may beco me involved in 
dangerous, risk-taking behaviors, such as reckless driving, or alcohol or drug 
use.  Others can become fearful of leaving home and avoid previ ous levels of 
activities.  Much of adolescence is focused on moving out into the world.  After a 
trauma, the view of the world can seem more dangerous and unsaf e.  A teenager 
may feel overwhelmed by intense emotions and yet feel unable to  discuss them

188Meeting the Child ’s Emotional Needs 
Children ’s reactions are in ﬂ uenced by the behavior, thoughts, and feelings of 
adults. Adults should encourage children and adolescents to sha re their thoughts 
and feelings about the incident.  Clarify misunderstandings abo ut risk and 
danger by listening to children ’s concerns and answering questions.  Maintain a 
sense of calm by validating children ’s concerns and perceptions and with discus-
sion of concrete plans for safety . 
Listen to what the child is saying.  If a young child is asking  questions about the 
event, answer them simply without the elaboration needed for an  older child or 
adult.  Some children are comforted by knowing more or less inf ormation than 
others; decide what level of information your particular child needs.  If a child 
has dif ﬁ culty expressing feelings, allow the child to draw a picture o r tell a story 
of what happened.Try to understand what is causing anxieties and fears.  Be awar e that following a 
disaster, children are most afraid that:
• The event will happen again.
• Someone close to them will be killed or injured.
• They will be left alone or separated from the family .
Reassuring Children After a Disaster 
Suggestions to help reassure children include the following:
• Personal contact is reassuring.  Hug and touch your children.
• Calmly provide factual information about the recent disaster a nd current plans 
for insuring their safety along with recovery plans.
• Encourage your children to talk about their feelings. 
• Spend extra time with your children such as at bedtime.
• Re-establish your daily routine for work, school, play , meals,  and rest.
• Involve your children by giving them speci ﬁ c chores to help them feel they 
are helping to restore family and community life.
• Praise and recognize responsible behavior.
• Understand that your children will have a range of reactions t o disasters.
• Encourage your children to help update your a family disaster plan.
If you have tried to create a reassuring environment by followi ng the steps above, 
but your child continues to exhibit stress, if the reactions wo rsen over time, or 
if they cause interference with daily behavior at school, at ho me, or with other 
relationships, it may be appropriate to talk to a professional.   You can get profes-
sional help from the child ’s primary care physician, a mental health provider 
specializing in children ’s needs, or a member of the clergy . Recovering from Disaster 5.0 Are You Ready?

Recovering
from DisasterMonitor and Limit Y our Family ’s Exposure to the Media 
News coverage related to a disaster may elicit fear and confusi on and arouse 
anxiety in children.  This is particularly true for large-scale  disasters or a terror-
ist event where signi ﬁ cant property damage and loss of life has occurred.  Par-
ticularly for younger children, repeated images of an event may  cause them to 
believe the event is recurring over and over.   
If parents allow children to watch television or use the Intern et where images 
or news about the disaster are shown, parents should be with th em to encour-
age communication and provide explanations. This may also inclu de parent ’s 
monitoring and appropriately limiting their own exposure to anx iety-provoking 
information. 
Use Support Networks
Parents help their children when they take steps to understand and manage 
their own feelings and ways of coping.  They can do this by bui lding and using 
social support systems of family , friends, community organizati ons and agencies, 
faith-based institutions, or other resources that work for that  family .  Parents can 
build their own unique social support systems so that in an eme rgency situation 
or when a disaster strikes, they can be supported and helped to  manage their 
reactions.  As a result, parents will be more available to thei r children and better 
able to support them.  Parents are almost always the best sourc e of support for 
children in dif ﬁ cult times. But to support their children, parents need to att end 
to their own needs and have a plan for their own support. Preparing for disaster helps everyone in the family accept the fact that disasters 
do happen, and provides an opportunity to identify and collect the resources 
needed to meet basic needs after disaster.  Preparation helps; when people feel 
prepared, they cope better and so do children. 
Helping Others
The compassion and generosity of the American people is never m ore evident than 
after a disaster.  People want to help.  Here are some general guidelines on helping 
others after a disaster:
• Volunteer! Check with local organizations or listen to local n ews reports for 
information about where volunteers are needed.  Note:  Until volunteers are 
speci ﬁ cally requested, stay away from disaster areas.
• Bring your own food, water, and emergency supplies to a disast er area if you 
are needed there.  This is especially important in cases where a large area has 
been affected and emergency items are in short supply .
• Give a check or money order to a recognized disaster relief or ganization.  
These groups are organized to process checks, purchase what is needed, and 
get it to the people who need it most.Recovering from Disaster 5.0      Are You Ready?
190• Do not drop off food, clothing, or any other item to a governm ent agency 
or disaster relief organization unless a particular item has be en requested.  
Normally , these organizations do not have the resources to sort  through the 
donated items. 
• Donate a quantity of a given item or class of items (such as n onperishable 
food) rather than a mix of different items.  Determine where yo ur donation 
is going, how it ’s going to get there, who is going to unload it, and how it is 
going to be distributed.  Without suf ﬁ cient planning, much needed supplies 
will be left unused.

"Elements and Considerations of a Successful Disaste r 
Preparedness Supplemental Communications Plan 
using the Personal Radio Services  
  
Including GMRS, FRS, MURS, and CB  
(References to the Amateur Radio Service)  
  
(This is a work in progress. PRA invites comments. Send those comments to the author, 
Doug Smith, at doug@praweb.org)  
  
Purpose 
  
This document is intended to be a bullet-point reso urce and reference for persons, 
organizations, CERT teams, and OEMs interested in d eveloping community 
communications programs that use the Family Radio S ervice, General Mobile Radio 
Service, Citizens Radio Service, and Multi-Use Radi o Service.  
  
The Amateur Radio Service is discussed but we refer  you to your local Amateur Radio 
Emergency Service (ARES) and Radio Amateur Civil Em ergency Service (RACES) 
Coordinators for assistance and advice. Every OEM s hould proactively involve itself with 
the local ARES and RACES and use these groups as yo ur PRIMARY source of 
supplemental communications systems and operators w hen normal systems collapse or 
are seriously over loaded. Amateur Radio operators have, for almost a century, provided 
emergency and disaster communication as part of the ir FCC licensee mandate in the 
Amateur FCC Rules and Regulations. 
  
Set Public Expectations  
  People need to know what to expect after a disaster . Setting expectations is the most 
overlooked aspect of many service related businesse s and is no less important in 
emergency management. It is akin to making sure bot h parties in an agreement 
thoroughly understand the mutually agreed upon term s of their contract. When people do 
not know what to expect they get angry, lose focus,  become impatient, and then anger 
and pandemonium results. In the case of a disaster,  panic prevails over common sense. 
We cannot let that happen in our communities. After  a disaster CERT Volunteers and 
public safety agencies are focused on triage. These  entities want to do the most good for 
the most people in the shortest amount of time. The  public needs to know what to do in 
the first seventy-two hours after a major disaster.  
  
Likewise we  CANNOT  create expectations that are impossible to meet.  There are 
efforts to declare Family Radio Service Channel one  as an emergency channel. The 
concept is that any citizen could use a Family Radi o Service radio to make a blind call for 
help to a monitoring Amateur radio operator after a  disaster event. The proposal claims it 
is “instant, reliable crisis communications,” but t his is far from the truth. Such a plan is 
unmanageable in its scope, particularly when no nei ghborhood familiarization or training 
is even suggested and in fact declared by the major  proponent as unnecessary ! Despite 
pleas from the Personal Radio Association the backe rs of this effort still promote this 
dangerous scheme.  
  
Planners need to provide the general public with so me idea of the “who, what, when, 
where, why and how” behind the mitigation efforts f or the aftermath of a disaster. 
Planners need to do this before the disaster and NO T after the disaster! It should be an 
aggressive effort of the utmost importance. One way  to accomplish this is to engage the 
public in disaster planning at the grass-roots-neig hborhood level. (CERT, neighborhood 
associations, Neighborhood Watch, local public meeti ngs, REACT, building associations, 
parks and recreation meetings, public awareness adv ertising on radio and television etc.)  
  
The public must accept a level of a responsibility toward disaster preparation in order to 
understand their role in disaster recovery. Setting  expectations means the public learns 
basic concepts and can keep those concepts in mind so that clear thinking prevails over 
panic thinking.  
  
There are not enough communications disaster worker s to fulfill the needs of the Family 
Radio Channel One monitoring scheme. The idea compl etely ignores the pre-planned 
typical response to a major disaster in the first t wenty-four to seventy-two hours. Setting 
the expectation that a rescuer is waiting and liste ning to a Family Radio might mean that some families will shelter in place after they have  been asked by public safety to 
evacuate! Setting the wrong expectation can crate n ew disaster victims and new dangers 
for rescuers. It is an excellent idea for neighbors  to create their own Family Radio 
Network to assist in checking up on each other after  a shelter-in-place emergency. An 
FRS radio and back-up batteries for each family mem ber should be part of every seventy-
two-hour disaster kit. 
  
The following are some expectations to take into co nsideration for a 
communications plan using the various Personal Radi o Services.  
  
  
1. The Federal Communications Commission Rules and Reg ulations must be 
followed in every case. Licenses must be obtained w here necessary and all users 
should be familiar with Part 95 of the FCC Rules as  they pertain to GMRS and to 
the unlicensed FRS also in Part 95. The same goes f or other radio services in use 
like Amateur Radio, FCC R&R Part 97, CB Radio Servi ce Part 95, and the 
Business Radio Services in Part 90. Obeying the rul es prevents anarchy, 
disorganization, and harmful interference. 
2. Neighbors must plan to be without emergency services  for up to seventy-two 
hours or more after a disaster. (More or less depen ding on the severity and scope 
of the event.) Every jurisdiction has a policy rega rding the delivery of services 
after a disaster. It needs to be explained. People’s expectations must be set.  
3. Emergency OES/OEM officials need to explain the exp ected role FRS and GMRS 
(Personal Radio Services) have in the event of a di saster. What it can and cannot 
do and what it is expected to do, how it can be use d, how it should not be used. To 
this the OEM’s need to know what resources are avai lable: 
a. Are there GMRS repeaters in your community? What th e coverage areas? 
How many families? Where are the base stations? Are  the repeaters 
connected to emergency power? Will the owners make the repeaters 
available? 
b. Where are the GMRS licensees in your community? Do they have base 
stations, repeater capable radios? Are these licens ees in isolated 
neighborhoods? Could they be used to report for CER T back to an OEC 
after an emergency? Does the EOC have licensed GMRS  operators to man 
a GMRS base station at the EOC? 
4. Any use of disaster related supplemental two-way ra dio to relay information to 
public safety officials must be planned for and tes ted ahead of time. There must 
be alternate plans e.g. a Plan B. 
5. Possession and use of an FRS or GMRS two-way radio does not guarantee an 
instant and reliable or an immediate and effective response to an individual’s call 
for help using that radio. NEVER  set the expectation that calling out on a two-way 
radio will guarantee a response. Unfortunately, sin ce this concept has already been heavily publicized some families may already b elieve it is a done deal. 
OEM’s need to reach these families before the next disaster. 
6. Whenever possible, use cellular or land-line teleph ones instead of two-way radios. 
Conventional methods of communication (communicatio n systems the public is 
already familiar with) should always be the preferr ed method of communication. 
It is recognized that these systems may be down or temporarily unavailable 
immediately after a disaster event. It is the time period immediately after the 
event and just before these systems are restored th at very-local neighborhood two-
way radio communication can be of the greatest help  in mitigating welfare checks 
and rescues. 
7. Two-way radios are primarily for neighbors to commu nicate with each other 
during and after a disaster so that CERT volunteers  or others can provide 
immediate search and rescue or so neighbors can ass ist each other. 
8. Two-way radio users must learn how to use their rad ios properly. They should 
know how to turn it on and off, how to change chann els, disable coded squelch 
tones, adjust the volume, and transmit. 
9. Emergency aid may not be available to some people w hether or not they have a 
radio. They may be isolated due to impassable condi tions, flooding, down power 
lines, fire, fallen structures, blocked roads, or t here may not be public safety or 
other resources to assist them. 
10. While it cannot be guaranteed, having a two-way rad io may enable appropriate 
officials to communicate with persons in isolated a reas. 
11. Emergency management leaders, CERT trainers, and ho bby radio operators need 
to train their neighbors in the use of two-way radi os.  
12. Persons should be expected to obey emergency manage ment officials and LEAVE 
potential disaster areas before the event! When you  are asked or ordered to leave a 
potential disaster area LEAVE! If you cannot leave on your own seek assistance 
but leave! Do not stick around expecting to use you r tiny little FRS radio to call 
for help if you find yourself in deep water! 
13. Since we generally have a very good understanding o f what can occur in a natural 
disaster in the United States every person should p lan accordingly. Offices of 
OES and OEM have pamphlets and websites persons can  visit for disaster 
planning information.  
14. The laws of physics as those laws relate to radio p ropagation of UHF radio waves 
apply to the eventual range of a radio in a given c ircumstance. The laws of sales 
and marketing do not apply. 
15. Amateur Radio operators are NOT allowed to transmit  on GMRS in an 
emergency with modified equipment on GMRS. (Or with  Part 95 approved 
equipment.) Amateur Radio operators do NOT have GMRS  privileges at any 
time. 
16. The public must understand the procedures and reaso ns for evacuation and NOT 
ignore evacuation warnings.  
  
  As you Begin Planning Ask these Questions  
  
1. Who needs to talk to whom and when and for how long  does that does that 
communication need to take place? This is going to be determined by how you 
deploy personnel. It may often NOT be necessary for personnel to carry radios of 
any kind.  
a. Field disaster worker to EOC 
b. Field disaster worker to disaster worker? 
c. Field disaster worker to on-scene public safety per sonnel.  
2. How far will you need to communicate? 
3. Do you need a relay by radio or telephone? 
4. Who, what, where are your relay resources? 
5. Is it necessary to deploy citizen volunteers with c ommunications equipment they 
use or is it sufficient to relay information throug h on-scene public safety 
personnel? How many people and which people will ha ve radios? (Not every 
person in a large apartment building needs a radio. ) 
6. Do you have alternates for your Block Captains? (Or  whatever you call your very-
local neighborhood emergency coordinators.) 
7. What kind of interference may already exist on FRS and GMRS in my area? 
8. Can the interference be mitigated? 
9. What is the likelihood of intentional interference and how will interference be 
dealt with it if it happens? 
10. Which radio channels shall we use for our neighborh ood? Select based on current 
use. Scan the FRS and GMRS channels. Monitor activi ty. Choose the quietest 
frequencies for your area. GMRS repeater output cha nnels may be busy with 
higher powered radio stations. Very-local communica tions should use FRS one-
fourteen. 
11. Are GMRS repeaters available? Where are they? Who i s already using them? Can 
your neighborhood benefit from using the repeaters?  
12. Have the licensees of those GMRS repeaters, or have  other GMRS licensees been 
asked to join the neighborhood team? Remember GMRS repeaters are private 
property. While most licensees will be happy to par ticipate as part of a local 
communications plan they are NOT required to do so.  AT this FCC database you 
can search for GMRS licensees in your zip code: 
http://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/UlsSearch/searchGmr s.jsp  
13. Does your local repeater have a tone for the neighb orhood? (CTCSS/DCS) 
14. How far away are we from the main roads?  
15. Will our radios reach from our residences to key ne ighborhood access points? 
Have we tested our neighborhood network? 
16. Can we communicate with other neighborhoods? Do we need to? 
17. Is there a way to relay requests for help beyond th e range of FRS? Beyond the 
range of GMRS? 18. Are there critical services, plants, roads, etc in the neighborhood where we should 
put someone with a radio? Water pumping plant, club  houses, damns, beaches, 
guard shacks, major intersections etc. 
19. Are we prepared to direct public safety resources t o rescues and medical 
emergencies after a disaster? How can we use our ra dios to do this? 
20. Do we have a GMRS licensee in my neighborhood? Is t hat licensee part of our 
plan? 
21. Do we have an Amateur Radio operator in our neighbo rhood? Is that Ham part of 
our plan? 
22. Does or OEM office know about our group? 
23. Do our OEM and local public safety officials have a  copy of our neighborhood 
communications plan? 
24. Has our OEM trained us on basic emergency planning?  
25. Do we have a neighborhood map and local telephone l ist? Is there an alerting 
calling-tree to alert neighbors to take cover? 
26. Do we have a welfare telephone calling-tree created  to check on neighbors on a 
priority basis! Elderly first! 
27. Does our OEM have a CERT program? Do we have traine d people in our 
neighborhood? 
28. Do we have a meeting place for training? Can we arr ange one? 
29. Do we have meetings already scheduled so we can add  this topic to the agenda? 
  
Something to think about: The Escalation of Alterna tive Communication Need  
  
Just as law enforcement must consider the escalatio n of force in the apprehension of 
potentially violent criminal suspects so to does th e communications planner consider a 
supplemental communication resource escalation meth odology for a disaster. 
  
1. Whenever possible, all normal day-to-day communicat ions systems should be 
used and when alternative or supplemental communica tions systems are in place 
the objective should be to return to normal systems  when normal systems are 
restored or are adequate for the need. Normal syste ms are staffed by public safety, 
municipal, county, state or federal personnel. Assu mes all landline, cellular and 
public safety radio systems are in place and not ov erwhelmed.  
2. When agencies do require supplemental communication  they should look first to 
their own public safety mutual aid plans. When thos e plans are insufficient use the 
trained volunteers of the Amateur Radio Service to free up critical public safety 
resources. Communication relay functions to and fro m an EOC/OES/OEC from 
disaster or other critical locations should be staf fed by trained Amateur Radio Operators of the Amateur Radio Emergency Service/Ra dio Amateur Civil 
Emergency Service.  
3. When there are insufficient Amateur Radio resources  or there are isolated 
neighborhoods with no resident Amateur Radio operat or consider licensing 
neighbors in the General Mobile Radio Service. GMRS  licensees can use base or 
mobile stations up to fifty-watts of power and ther e is no license test just a simple 
on-line application. Supplemental very-local short- distance neighborhood 
communication in the same vicinity is available in the Family Radio Service. A 
GMRS licensee can report to an EOC on GMRS frequenc ies provided the EOC 
has a licensed GMRS operator. 
4. The VHF Multi-Use Radio Service can be used for sho rt-distance neighborhood 
communication and possibly for communication back t o an EOC.  
5. OEM’s should not overlook companies with fleets of radios in the various 
business radio services. Company vehicles with radi os could be positioned with 
CERT teams and communicate back to an EOC.  
  
  
Assumptions about the Personal Radio Services  
  
1. Many persons using FRS radios will have little or n o prior communication 
training. They will have no confidence in the metho d or the device. Some may 
even refuse to own or learn to use one. 
2. Radios may prove completely frustrating to some peo ple and they will give up 
using them and resort to calling out for help. Plan ners should plan around both 
scenarios and NOT rely solely on two-way radios. 
3. Some area residents may have read or heard about th e Family Radio Channel One 
disaster scheme and may actually start calling out on FRS 1 after an emergency. It 
is unrealistic to expect that every disaster worker  can carry an FRS radio but those 
that can or are allowed to should. This may be help ful if FRS or GMRS is used 
for supplemental communication in a remote area.  
4. Calling out for help, if within earshot of a neighb or, makes more sense than taking 
the time to find one’s radio. Neighbors in no immedi ate peril will exit their homes 
safely and begin checking on others. CERT volunteer s are trained to assist in 
situations where their safety is concerned.  Some d isaster victims in severely 
damaged structures will have to wait for profession al rescuers whether they call 
for help out loud or using an FRS radio. 
5. Some persons may have no or very limited experience  with a two-way radio. 
Finding the push-to-talk function may be difficult for some.  
6. Some users of FRS and GMRS radios will panic and ca use unwanted interference 
trying to reach anyone they can hear. They may even  unwittingly interfere with 
rescues in progress. Batteries could be exhausted w ithin hours of the disaster. 
When these radios are used in a neighborhood the lo cal trainers should explain wilderness protocols so that battery life is extend ed and the likelihood of a rescue 
improved as time proceeds. 
a. Wilderness protocol:  (modified from an example use d by the Amateur 
Radio Service. All stations (both fixed, portable o r mobile) monitor 
Personal Radio Service frequencies every three hour s. Monitoring 
locations that have sufficient power resources moni tor for five minutes 
starting at the top of every hour, or continuously.   
b. Scan all frequencies. This increases the possibilit y that trapped persons 
who cannot properly operate a radio might be heard.  
  
7. Some users of radios may be trapped in buildings or  in other dangerous locations. 
It may be difficult to locate these people. Some ve ry-local responders should be 
trained in simple radio direction finding technique s to approximate the location of 
trapped radio users. (Body fading.)  Local Amateur Radio Service volunteers and 
Squadrons of the Civil Air Patrol have expertise in  radio direction finding. 
8. CTCSS and DCS settings will prevent communication a nd cause severe 
confusion. The public should be taught to use radio s with these squelch codes 
disabled. 
9. Individuals with criminal intent may attempt to tak e advantage of persons in 
distress, or fake distress calls in order to identi fy the location of law enforcement 
or search and rescue resources or unprotected prope rties to coordinate looting. 
10. The lack of training and sophistication of users re quires extraordinary personal 
communication and negotiation abilities of persons carrying radios and 
responding to victims. Some pre-disaster communicat ions training is required. 
11. CB may be useless or of very limited range. Most CB ’s will be in cars. There will 
be a few base stations. Communication during period s of active shortwave skip 
may be limited depending on local terrain. 
12. MURS users will be scarce. 
13. Many families will already own an FRS or a GMRS bub ble-pack radio. Not 
everyone in the family will know how to use them. I n most cases batteries will be 
dead or will soon be dead since most radios cannot be recharged in a vehicle. 
14. Some two-way radio users will not cooperate with ne ighborhood groups and will 
do as they please. Some may even cause deliberate i nterference. 
15. Some smaller groups will organize and use FRS and G MRS radios without being 
part of a larger plan. OEM officials will eventuall y learn about these groups and 
have difficulty verifying their authenticity. Some may lay claim to specific radio 
frequencies as their own. (Licensing encourages peo ple to follow rules that 
prevent mutual interference.) 
16. Local business radio users are going to be using th eir own business radio 
channels. OES OEM should coordinate with companies that have large fleets to 
take advantage of business repeaters and high power ed simplex radios. 
  Planning 
  
•        Participants using GMRS should license in GMRS. Pla nning should include 
local GMRS licensees. There should be an effort to license families in GMRS 
in America’s neighborhoods that want to help each o ther during or 
immediately after an emergency using two-way radios . 
•        Encourage local jurisdictions to have an FRS GMRS c ommunications plan 
within the existing FCC Rules governing both servic es. These jurisdictions 
should locate and negotiate with all GMRS resources . 
•        GMRS based organizations can create a committee to explore the appropriate 
use of the FRS in an emergency for their area and m ake recommendations to 
OES/OEMs. GMRS groups should support community base d disaster 
communication plans and work within those plans to provide public 
emergency communications.   
•        GMRS repeater owners should invite new families ont o their systems so 
families get used to operating GMRS radio systems. 
•        The public needs informative packets, and training information.    No disaster 
program will work without training.  This includes extremely basic radio 
operation instructions, storage of spare batteries,  and disaster related supplies. 
Such training should be provided through local offi ces of emergency 
management or groups with CERT affiliations, Neighbo rhood Watch, 
community associations etc. 
•        Set the public expectation of FRS channel one as an  emergency radio 
frequency to summon assistance on demand. Remember,  OEM’s warn 
persons in areas anticipating weather related emerg encies that public safety 
cannot respond to telephone calls immediately after  a disaster. Calling for help 
or rescue on a Family Radio Service portable radio does not increase your 
chances of emergency assistance. 
•        In a local plan make use of radio frequencies after  surveying your areas 
normal activity. Create a primary and backup channe l.  Do not put simplex 
radio traffic on a local repeater output. 
•        Know your neighbors ahead of time. Get to know folk s on a first and last 
name basis before the disaster strikes. 
•        Have designated alternates for important tasks. •        Every family should have a communications plan for a disaster. This includes 
a telephone contact plan, family-expectation settin g regarding future welfare 
related telephone calls. Every family should have o ne designated contact 
person far from the emergency (another city or stat e) that can be a single point 
of contact for all family members. 
•        Disaster communications planners, while taking into  consideration the 
limitations of GMRS and FRS should: 
a.       Share with neighborhoods the benefits of communicat ing after an 
emergency to assess the welfare of persons by radio  in a very local 
way. 
b.      The need for a neighbor or neighbors to learn how t o effectively use a 
two-way radio during and immediately after a disast er. 
c.       Encourage neighbors to use radios with coded-squelc h disabled. 
d.      Develop local ways for neighborhoods to communicate  with 
OES/OEM officials. 
  
Suggestions  
  
1. A neighborhood should standardize on a particular m ake and model of FRS radio 
(if possible) for those people that have no prior e xperience using radios and that 
might be likely to have problems using their radios . 
2. Pick a radio that uses regular alkaline batteries y ou can replace. When electricity 
is out you may not be able to recharge your recharg eable batteries. 
3. Some simple method of wearing the radio on the belt , around the neck, or clipped 
to clothing should be devised so it is not lost. (E specially for the elderly and the 
sick.) 
4. Use of call tones should be discouraged. These tone s serve no useful purpose. 
They make the radio an obnoxious toy. 
5. A neighborhood communications volunteer should set up FRS radios for those 
that cannot do it properly themselves. 
6. Neighborhoods should have Block Captains. Block Capt ains have the 
responsibility to call everyone on the radio during  and after a disaster to verify the 
welfare of people in the homes and buildings around  them. 
7. Large buildings should have designated Floor Captai ns and alternates that carry 
radios. Every building should have a communications  plan in place with their 
evacuation plan. It is not realistic that every emp loyee should carry an FRS radio in a business structure but key employees that are part of the neighborhood 
disaster plan should do so. 
8. A neighborhood’s radio system should be tested at l east four times a year. A good 
time may be just prior to a Neighborhood Watch meeti ng or local disaster 
preparedness meeting. Neighbors should use their ra dios informally all year so 
they become familiar with the radio. 
9. As many volunteers as can be found should take CERT  training so everyone 
responding to calls from help can so do with some c onfidence and without injury. 
10. CERT teams should not have to design or re-design c ommunications systems or 
methods already included in their local disaster pl ans. CERT emphasis is on 
rescue and public welfare. Disaster planners should  do this work for CERT 
volunteers. 
11. Neighbors who want to license in the GMRS should pay  the license fee, and buy a 
base station and mobile radio capable of attaching to an external antenna. These 
neighbors can be a link to a designated resource up  the communications chain. 
12. Amateur Radio operators in the neighborhood should be identified and included 
in neighborhood communications planning. Amateurs c an serve as a 
neighborhood’s link back to the designated public s afety agency. Areas with great 
distances between neighborhoods can benefit from su ch a scheme.   
13. A neighborhood should be included in a multi-hazard  functional plan for the 
jurisdiction in which it is located. Contact person s, and their addresses and phone 
numbers should be kept up to date for every local n eighborhood. This is easier to 
do through Neighborhood Watch or Neighborhood Associ ation meetings since 
these are regularly conducted by local police juris dictions. 
14. When using a radio to talk to a neighbor use plain language. Do not use ten codes. 
15.  Use radio codes instead of plain language only if you can guarantee there will be 
no misunderstandings.  
16. Maritime communities should think about communicati ng with each other on 
GMRS and FRS. VHF maritime channels cannot be legal ly used on land. The 
maritime channels may be busy with maritime distres s activities. 
17. Teach everyone who owns a radio how to use the radi o with specific emphasis on: 
a. Listening before transmitting 
b. Disabling CTCSS and DCS 
c. Disabling scrambling 
d. Speaking in plain language. 
e. Directing all communications to a specific person o r unit. 
f. Responding only to known persons. 
g. How to make a general call to anyone that can hear you only when you 
cannot reach designated persons. 
h. Having enough batteries on hand to use your radio c ontinuously for at 
least seventy-two hours. 
i. Keeping your radio and batteries within easy to rea ch, away from areas 
that might be damaged during earthquakes or storms.  
j. In advance warning of an emergency putting your rad io on your belt or 
clipping it to your clothing.  k. Putting packs of extra batteries in your pocket in case you are not able to 
get back to your supply in the event of a building collapse. 
l. In advance of a disaster warning, attempt to contac t other members of 
your neighborhood group and check in with Block Cap tains. Block 
Captains should have paper and pencil to record nam es and addresses of 
check-ins. It is also good to know who has already evacuated.  
m. Have a current neighborhood map with address number s, telephone 
numbers, and names of families recorded on the map.  
n. After a disaster Block Captains should contact ever y person that checked 
in and attempt to contact those that did not. 
o. Block Captains should allow persons in actual distr ess to check in before 
those that are not. Everyone needs to know they are  helped by 
neighborhood resources on a priority basis!  
p. Persons in distress should begin transmitting the m oment they determine 
their vocal cries for help are not being heard. Tra nsmit and listen, transmit 
and listen. “This is Bill on Main St. Please help m e.” Stop transmitting 
when you are called or are asked to do so. Indicate  you are injured when 
you are called. State your name, last known locatio n (where you should 
be), and the nature of your emergency.  (follow a s uggested wilderness 
protocol like that mentioned in this document)   
q. Signaling in the event you cannot speak. Radios req uire speech, but you 
can create a method of signaling, or responding to yes and no questions if 
you can tap or rub the radio against a solid object  while transmitting. 
Whatever system you develop should be widely unders tood among the 
neighbors and only used as a last resort. Be prepar ed to answer once for 
yes two for no. 
r. Preventing an open-microphone condition and what to  do if one happens 
e.g. switching to an alternate channel. 
  
  
OES/OEM’s, Public Safety - Make a Commitment Now  
  
There are some considerations in this list that are  frankly, a little outside the scope of 
FRS and GMRS but these should be considered so that  FRS and GMRS use can be 
considered in context by disaster planners. 
  
• OES/OEM’s that plan for supplemental communication functions need to 
encourage and train volunteers through drills and o rganized training. Volunteers 
need encouragement, recognition, drills, training e tc. • Determine the supplemental communications needs of every neighborhood, 
public safety agency, major utility etc and work yo ur volunteers into those places. 
Amateur Radio RACES and ARES should be your primary  supplemental civilian 
communications resource.  
• In the case of Amateur Radio volunteers, Public Saf ety agencies, particularly 
police, have an obligation to use Amateurs as RACES  volunteers and not ARES 
volunteers. This does not mean the local Ham popula tion has to be Balkanized! 
This just means that Hams assigned to work a specif ic agency are volunteers at 
that agency as well as members of the local ARES. T hey wear two hats. Public 
Safety agencies often fingerprint RACES volunteers.   This allows agencies to 
assert some control over the quality and integrity of volunteers that serve. In most 
cases it also qualifies volunteers to receive workm an’s compensation insurance 
benefits if injured in the line of duty. 
• Actively train and provide drills for volunteers.  
• Avoid using your communications volunteers in other  roles. It makes sense to 
train communications volunteers so that they unders tand the concepts behind the 
disaster mitigation effort. Their expertise is howe ver communications. After a 
disaster, that expertise is valuable and in some ca ses they may prove more 
valuable as a communicator than as neighborhood sea rch and rescue volunteer.  
• Encourage firefighters, Dispatch, OES/OEM, medical personnel, and police 
officers to become Amateur Radio operators. These f olks are often highly 
motivated leaders of volunteers. They understand ho w to get things done in 
government and planners tend to take them seriously . Volunteers feel honored to 
serve alongside their very qualified partners. It c an truly make a difference in 
training, and effectiveness to have 911 staff, poli ce staff, and even firefighters 
become Amateur radio operators. 
• By making a commitment you are more likely to ident ify those volunteers that 
should not be part of a program before an emergency  occurs. You can also work 
with local volunteer groups to create other useful jobs for volunteers. When you 
set standards and set expectations for volunteers y ou will have a better program. 
• Setting up a grass-roots neighborhood supplemental communications plan is 
difficult. The reason is that the people doing the communicating are not 
necessarily radio or communications enthusiasts. Th eir primary interest is the 
safety of family and neighbors. (CERT) Whatever you  decide to set up should not 
diminish the primary role of the CERT volunteer. 
• An OES/OEM may not have the resources to train comm unicators but your local 
Amateur/GMRS population does! It is what they alrea dy do. They can serve you 
well in this function. Trainers that are currently or former public safety employees 
make excellent trainers. Work hard to develop a tra iner’s skills and help them 
write a training program with which your agency is comfortable. 
• Avoid competing communications volunteer programs. Political jurisdictions 
should make this a requirement for OES/OEM’s and al l volunteer groups. There 
is no room for griping, finger pointing, politics, or empire building in 
communications disaster planning. That message must  be conveyed to volunteers. 
Plans should not be Balkanized among or across club s or special interest groups. • CERT volunteers needing communications should not b e in the position of having 
to set up their own communications methodologies wi thout appropriate 
leadership. You do not want these groups re-inventi ng the wheel. Involve RACES 
volunteers and GMRS licensees as communicators for CERT teams. 
• When you find it difficult to recruit communication s volunteers work harder at it. 
Ask people why they no longer bother to volunteer a nd you may be surprised. It is 
not necessarily their age or lack of interest. On t he contrary, it is often that when 
volunteers do express an interest in serving the va rious jurisdictions do not take 
the volunteers seriously. Amateur Radio Operators h ave often been in the 
position, despite an incredible record of service, of having to sell their capabilities 
and themselves to political jurisdictions over and over again because the 
jurisdictions do not take the Amateurs seriously. T he same goes for GMRS 
groups. Do not wait for them to come to you, go to them. Over and over again 
Amateurs have proven their value perhaps just not y ou – not yet anyway. 
• Make sure your OES/OEM leaders are the right people . It is not a desk job. It’s a 
people job, an organizers job, a political job, a l eadership job, and a tough job.  
The skills required are supervisory, managerial, or ganizational, and political. 
There is a strong emphasis on the ability to manage  resources and supervise 
various types and levels of volunteer resources. 
• The diversity of America’s neighborhoods makes an a pproach to a supplemental 
communications or CERT program different on many le vels. How you make it 
work and what you do with it is going to depend on very-local circumstances. A 
CERT approach in a farming community is going to ne cessarily be different than 
a CERT approach in an inner city apartment building . 
• When you create very-local communications plans dec ide first what it is you want 
these communicators to do. Is communicating their j ob or is communication 
necessary to get their real job done? These are two very different things.  An 
Amateur Radio operator trains to provide supplement al communications and it is 
his or her job. A CERT neighbor trains to rescue an  elderly neighbor from the 
debris of a collapsed building and he/she needs to communicate status and 
requests for additional resources while getting the ir real work done. This is also 
one major reason why you do not want a CERT leader to have to reinvent 
communications plans! Assign a communicator to find  and train your CERT in 
the appropriate radio service that can provide tact ical communication after an 
emergency. The communicator then trains the trainer s who train the neighbors. 
• Training is easier than you think. Start train-the- trainer programs for 
neighborhood volunteers. 
• Standardize training. Use handouts, Power Point, le ctures, and demonstrations. 
• Train people not only how to do something but also discuss why it is so 
important. Discuss the potential consequences for p lan failures due to modified 
personal interpretations and implementations. 
• OEM’s and communications trainers should identify l oose canons – people with 
scary security guard mentalities, or personality pr oblems that can make them a 
liability and not an asset. Neighborhoods can find s omething for these folks to do 
but they should not be responsible for the success of a program if they are not 
likely to follow rules, guidelines, laws, or polici es. It is OK to set standards and ask neighborhood volunteers to accept those standar ds. Develop volunteer 
agreements that contain a span of control, and a sc ope of work and a defined 
chain of command within your Incident Command Syste m. Standards of behavior 
and the organization of the volunteer service need to be clearly understood. 
Volunteers must be required to sign a document indi cating their understanding of 
policies and procedures.  
• It is highly recommended that any disaster communic ations volunteer having 
official access to restricted areas be trained as C ERT volunteers are in the local 
Incident Command System and that they be fingerprin ted and at a minimum those 
fingerprints are checked through your state’s Depar tment of Justice (CORI) or 
equivalent using procedures in place for public saf ety applicants. Volunteers with 
criminal records should be excused from service. 
  
  
A Quick Look at the Personal Radio Services  
  
Citizens Radio Service  
  
• The service was originally created to provide the p ublic with a simple, low-cost 
radio service on which to conduct personal business  or commerce. 
• CB was created in the high-end of the short-wave ra dio spectrum. It is the old 
Amateur Radio Services eleven meter band. 
• Short-wave radio signals propagate over great dista nces.  Low power CB radio 
 can be heard around the world. Every eleven years the sunspot cycle causes 
reliable world-wide propagation. 
• The first CB rules and those of today forbid operat ors from talking to others that 
are over one-hundred fifty miles away.  
• When average citizens discovered they could talk gr eat distances like Amateur 
Radio operators they began using CB illegally to “s hoot skip.”  CB was rendered 
a useless wasteland by these outlaw hobbyists. 
• The problem of illegal CB use became so great that the FCC abandoned licensing 
of CB stations. The FCC even abandoned enforcement to a great extent by asking 
Congress to allow local jurisdictions to investigat e complaints of illegal power 
amplifiers. The FCC does still occasionally locate and fine illegal operators but 
their emphasis has now been placed on enforcement a ctivities directed at retailers 
of illegal CB radio equipment. 
• There is now complete anarchy on CB. Illegal hobbyi sts have had control of the 
band for decades.  • Illegal CB operations were the impetuous behind ext raordinarily restrictive 
covenants, codes, and restrictions against radio op eration in homes and 
neighborhoods. In some areas of the country housing  discrimination is reportedly 
being practiced against licensed radio hobbyists – including Amateur Radio 
Operators. 
• The use of illegal CB power amplifiers is still a p roblem throughout the United 
States. 
• There are very few home CB base stations now. 
• CB is widely used by the trucking industry so drive rs can communicate with each 
other on the highways and in some cases their deliv ery depots. 
• CB hobby communication is frequently profane, off-c olor, and juvenile. Most 
would say it is not a radio service they would want  their children to listen to. 
• CB is still used by some Americans in cars, by four -wheel-drive enthusiasts, in 
boats, and RV’s. 
• The useful distance of a CB radio is greatly reduce d during periods of short-wave 
band openings due to illegal hobby operations.  
• Very-local distance expectations between mobile uni ts can be from less than one 
mile to tens of miles. 
• The CB clubs of the past died out with the populari ty of CB.  
• Four-wheel drive clubs often have CB radios in all member vehicles. These clubs 
could be an excellent communications and transporta tion resource. They have 
their own communication and provide vehicles that c an go where many cannot. 
• CB walkie-talkie’s have very limited range because of low-profile and very 
inefficient antennas. 
• CB might be a useful way for neighbors in rural are as to talk to each other if they 
live within a few miles. 
• Local CB communication may be better at night when,  in most cases, hobby 
operations cease as signal propagation decreases. 
• CB should not be considered a highly reliable commu nications resource. 
Wherever you plan to use it, test it first. Insist that all use of radios be legal. Never 
allow illegal linear amplifiers to be used by volun teers. Planners should question 
the integrity of any volunteer breaking FCC Rules. 
• There are legitimate users of CB that do use their radios for family 
communication. The PRA believes that encouraging su ch use may eventually 
have an effect of the usefulness of the radio servi ce. 
  
  
  
  
  Multi-Use Radio Service  
  
• The Multi-Use Radio Service consists of five VHF ra dio frequencies. Operation 
on these frequencies does not require an FCC licens e; however, unlicensed 
operation does require that transceivers meet very specific FCC MURS 
requirements.  
• Transceivers that do not meet MURS requirements may  not be used without an 
FCC license. There are still licensed businesses sh aring these radio channels. 
• Some major radio manufacturers were not pleased wit h the FCC’s decision to 
create the MURS service and for this reason have st ubbornly refused to make 
equipment for it. Because of this, MURS radios are not as easy to find or purchase 
as one might think. 
• VHF radio waves propagate better through forested a reas. 
• Two watts on VHF may go considerably farther than t wo watts on UHF GMRS. 
• Businesses and unscrupulous radio dealers put custo mers on these five 
frequencies and deliberately failed to license. The  widespread abuse of the 
licensing requirement prompted the FCC to license-b y-rule just as the FCC did 
with the CB band. 
• Low-power VHF generally does not propagate like sho rt-wave radio. 
• Interference is likely to come from existing busine ss users and unlicensed 
business users. 
• Interference is more likely in urban areas. 
• These frequencies are often used as drive-up window  channels at restaurants and 
as portable-to-portable business radios in stores, warehouses, malls, construction 
sites, and as itinerant devices. 
• Users of this radio service are required to share t he frequencies they use. 
• MURS would be an acceptable very-local communicatio ns option for a 
neighborhood, particular where forests and rolling hills are plentiful. 
  
  
Family Radio Service  
  
• The FRS is a license-free very-short-range radio se rvice. 
• FRS channels one through seven are shared with the General Mobile Radio 
Service.  
• GMRS licensees may have small base stations up to f ive watts effective radiated 
power on FRS one through seven. This rule can make FRS in a neighborhood 
useful if one licensed resident can communicate wel l with many local hand-held 
FRS radios. • FRS channels eight through fourteen are exclusive t o the FRS. 
• Families and businesses are both allowed to use rad ios that are FCC approved for 
the Family Radio Service. 
• Anarchy reigns on the FRS in urban areas. Interfere nce can be severe. 
• FRS radio waves travel line of sight.  
• Antenna height is more important to range than is t he power of the radio. 
Communication over tens of miles is possible from h igh altitudes. 
• Heavily forested areas limit the range of FRS. UHF radio waves are absorbed by 
vegetation. 
• Intentional interference on FRS is common. Call ton es are typically used to 
interfere and annoy others. 
• Very-local use of FRS around a neighborhood or a ho me is very effective.  
• FRS radios are limited to one-half watt output. 
• Only the United States and Canada share a Family Ra dio Service on the same 
frequencies.  Use of FRS radios in other countries is illegal. Some persons have 
obtained prior permission to use FRS frequencies in  other countries but this is the 
exception and not the rule. 
• Manufacturer marketing claims of useful communicati on beyond several hundred 
feet to one half mile are greatly exaggerated and i ntended only to sell radios by 
creating unrealistic expectations in the minds of c onsumers. 
• Children should not use FRS radios unsupervised. Pa rents should know who their 
children are talking to especially with the new Has bro text-messaging radios. 
• FRS radios are unfortunately also used by criminals . 
• Use of FRS radios as children’s toys should be disc ouraged. 
• Use of FRS radios and other two-way radios by hunte rs to coordinate the hunting 
of game may be regulated in some states. In some st ates it is considered 
unsportsmanlike conduct to coordinate the hunt usin g two-way radios. 
• FRS radios are perfect for neighbors to use to keep  in touch before, during, and 
after disasters. 
• FCC rules prohibit FRS radio connection to external  antennas. 
• FCC rules prohibit FRS radio connection to telephon e systems. 
• FCC rules prohibit FRS radio connection to store an d forward repeaters.  
  
  
General Mobile Radio Service  
  
• Use of GMRS is limited to personal licensees. Organ izations, clubs, and 
businesses are not eligible to license in GMRS. Ind ividuals are licensed upon 
application and payment of a license fee. The renew able license is good for five 
years. 
• Personal licensees may conduct their personal busin ess. • A person’s GMRS license covers their immediate fami ly members including 
members of the immediate family not living in the l icensee’s home. 
• A licensee is responsible for the proper operation of all radio equipment used as 
part of the licensee’s system.  
• GMRS base stations and mobile units may use externa l antennas and power 
outputs up to fifty watts. 
• GMRS licensees may use up to five watts effective r adiated power on GMRS 
interstitial channels also known as Family Radio Se rvice channels one through 
seven. 
• GMRS allows the use of radio repeater stations. 
• Higher power outputs of GMRS radios make communicat ions more reliable over 
greater distances. 
• GMRS repeaters are considered private property. Rep eaters may be shared by 
licensees but sharing agreements must be in writing  and kept with station records. 
  
  
Methods of Communication for Very-local Communicati on (Under development)  
  
The following suggestions are for very-local neighb orhood groups. Your implementation 
may vary depending upon colloquial circumstances. T his is not a one-size fits all 
approach.  
  
• The planner wants to choose simple-language communi cation methods rather than 
try to teach ten-codes or other similar codes used by public safety communicators. 
The general public speaks in words so stick with pl ain language call signs also 
called tactical identifiers.  
• Minimize future confusion by encouraging neighbors to use their radios for 
family use and events around the neighborhood. 
• Make FRS radios and perhaps even GMRS a tool of you r local Neighborhood 
Watch.  
  
  
Mistakes to Avoid  
  • CERT organizations have no right under law to issue  GMRS radios to unlicensed 
volunteers. There is a trend developing of jurisdic tions purchasing the twenty-two 
channel bubble-pack GMRS radios and issuing these r adios to volunteers. The 
uniformed believe these are FRS radios.  Jurisdicti ons tell volunteers to use the 
channels that do not require a license and to avoid  using the higher power GMRS 
channels unless told to do so. Some jurisdictions e ven make up their own rules to 
say when volunteers can use GMRS channels without l icense authority. This is 
inconsistent with the license requirements for thes e radios and is against FCC 
Rules. It is not good planning. Do not make this mi stake or you will run afoul of 
the law. Read the GMRS Rules in FCC R&R Part 95. Ob serve the license 
requirements for radios certified as GMRS radios.  
• Do not make the assumption that you have the right to do as you please with a 
GMRS radio because you represent a police, fire, or  OEM agency. The Federal 
Communications Commission makes the rules and enfor ces the rules. You may 
not interpret the rules for your own benefit. 
• Amateur Radio operators, public safety jurisdiction s, nor OES/OEM’s  should  
assume that they have the right to use GMRS radios without a license or to issue 
GMRS radios to non Hams in order to outfit citizen ACS teams. (Auxiliary 
Communications Service teams.) 
• Assume that your illegal operations on GMRS will be  noticed. Do not break the 
law. There is an ever growing membership of the Per sonal Radio Association 
taking responsibility for monitoring GMRS nationwid e. Unlicensed operation is 
reported to the Federal Communications Commission. You could find you or your 
agency having to explain to the FCC why you have ig nored and operated outside 
of the FCC Rules. 
• Do not permit Amateur Radio operators assisting as communications volunteers 
to use modified Amateur Radio equipment on GMRS fre quencies. This is not 
allowed under FCC Rules. Permitting your volunteers  to break the law is not the 
right thing to do. Local ARES/RACES leaders should certify that all Amateur 
Radio communications disaster service volunteers do  not operate with modified 
equipment. 
• Do not permit public safety employees to program GM RS channels in public 
safety radios or to use modified Amateur Radios on public safety frequencies. 
• Do not assume that your organization has the right to commandeer a GMRS or 
FRS channel for your exclusive use. 
  
  
Opportunities for Manufacturers  
  
Manufacturers have gone about the development and m arketing of FRS radios in all the 
wrong ways. Development is entirely about what the marketing manager expects will tempt the average citizen to buy the product withou t regard to licensing. The marketers 
want the radios loaded with features. They insist o n making bizarre claims as to the range 
radios will transmit effectively.  It is all about what a marketing manager believes will 
sell the product and not at all about how useful th e radio actually is. The most glaring 
examples are the intentional built-in complexities of these radios that should be so 
incredibly simple. Set-up menus and multiple contro ls confuse and bemuse the average 
citizen making the radios almost impossible to use.  One excellent argument against the 
use of today’s FRS/GMRS bubble-pack radios for use in emergency situations was put 
this way: 
  
 “Take any two FRS (or bubble-pack GMRS) radios fro m competing 
manufacturers and set each radio on a different cha nnel with different call 
tones. Hand the radios to an average person with an  instruction book and 
ask them to set the radios up so they can talk to e ach other.” One or both 
people will certainly give up and setting up a radi o to communicate during 
an emergency is too late!  
  
Manufacturers have an opportunity to reverse confus ion by developing FRS only radios 
for use in neighborhoods as radios for crime preven tion teams or CERT with the 
following features: 
  
1. FRS only channels so radios can be used license fre e. 
2. Elimination of the tone-coded squelch option. 
a. Eliminates complicated set up  
b. Eliminates problems associated with model differenc es between 
manufacturers 
c. Eliminates interference to GMRS repeaters when oper ated on FRS eight 
through fourteen. 
d. Enables persons to quickly and easily talk to each other. 
3. Elimination of the call tone feature. This feature has rarely served a useful 
purpose. It is most frequently used to interfere wi th and to annoy others. It makes 
the radio a toy. 
4. Simple one-button scan function. 
  
Why make the changes? 
  • CTCSS and DCS tones are difficult to set up in most  radios. 
• Manufacturers market CTCSS and DCS tones as privacy  feature when it is 
anything but a privacy feature.  
• Most people with CTCSS or DCS enabled will never li sten first before 
transmitting and often interfere with others. 
• An FRS radio with CTCSS or DCS enabled will prevent  communication with 
others. 
• Menu and push-button function set up methods are co nfusing and difficult to 
master. 
• Feature rich radios are communication poor. 
• Reduced complexity emphasizes voice communication. 
• An FRS-only radio is license free. Something that t hat has escaped the attention 
of manufacturers and marketing managers for a numbe r of years.  
  
Most serious GMRS licensees invest in high quality commercial-grade two-way radio 
equipment and have invested a great deal of money i n this equipment. Commercial-grade 
radios last longer, are more reliable, and in many cases much simpler to use. These radios 
may be of similar quality and manufacture as radios  in use by public safety agencies. 
  
  
Marine Radio  
  
The 156-160 MHz marine band is intended for use on the water. It is illegal to use a land 
based marine radio transceiver unless the station i s licensed as a coast station by the FCC. 
Obtaining a coast station license is not easy. Only  businesses and public safety agencies 
having a need to communicate with vessels on the wa ter is even eligible. Activities of the 
Coast Guard are also covered in Federal regulations . Citizens on board boats under a 
certain length and weight are allowed to use mobile  marine radio without a license. The 
average citizen may not operate a land based marine  coast station or even a marine 
portable radio while on land.

"Why talk about a Disaster Supplies Kit?
After a disaste r, local officials and relief workers will be on the scen e, but
they cannot reach everyone immediatel y. You could get help in hours, or it
may take days. Basic services, such as electricit y, gas, wate r, and tele-
phones, may be cut off, or you may have to evacuate at a moment ’s notice.
You probably won ’t have time to shop or search for the supplies you’ll
need. Your family will cope best by
preparing for disaster before it strikes.
What is a Disaster Supplies Kit?
Assembling the supplies you mightneed following a disaster is an impor-tant part of your Family Disaster Plan.Following a disaste r, having extra sup-
plies at home or supplies to take with
you in the event of an evacuation can help your family endure evacuationor home confinement. Learn more about Disaster Supplies Kits by contact-ing your local emergency management agency or American Red Cross
chapte r.
Awareness Information
Involve children in disaster p reparedness.
Ask children to help you remember to keep your kits in working order bychanging the food and water every six months and replacing batteries asnecessar y.  Children might make calendars or posters with the appropriate
dates marked on them. Ask children to think of items that they would liketo include in their own Disaster Supplies Kit, such as books or games orappropriate nonperishable food items.

Tips for Your Disaster Supplies Kit
• Keep a smaller Disaster Supplies Kit in the trunk of ea ch car.
If you become stranded or are not able to return hom e, having some
items will help you to be more comfortable until help arrives.
• Keep items in airtight plastic bags .This will help protect them from
damage or spoiling.
• Replace sto red food and water every six months .Replacing your
food and water supplies will help ensure their freshness.
• Rethink your kit and family needs at least once a year.Replace
batteries, update clothes, etc.
• Ask your p hysician or pharmacist about storing p rescription
medications .It may be difficult to obtain prescription medications dur-
ing a disaster because stores may be closed or supplies may be limited.
• Use an easy-to-carry container for the supplies you would 
most li kely need for an evacuation .Label it clearl y. Possible 
containers include:
n A larg e, covered trash containe r.
n A camping backpack.
n A duffel bag.
n A cargo container that will fit on the roof of your vehicle.
Disaster Supplies Kit Basics
The following items might be needed at home or for an evacuation.Keeping them in an easy-to-carry backpack or duffel bag near your door
would be best in case you need to evacuate quickl y, such as in a tsunami,
flash flood, or major chemical emergenc y. Store your kit in a co nvenient
place known to all family members. Kit basics are:• A portabl e, battery-powered radio or television and extra batteries.
• Flashlight and extra batteries.
• First aid kit and first aid manual.
• Supply of prescription medications.
• Credit card and cash.
• Personal identification.
• An extra set of car keys.
• Matches in a waterproof containe r.
• Signal flare.• Map of the area and phone numbers of places you could go.
• Special needs, for exampl e, diapers or formula, prescription medicines
and copies of prescriptions, hearing aid batteries, spare wheelchair batter y, spare eyeglasses, or other physical needs.
If you have additional spac e, consider adding some of the items from
your Evacuation Supplies Kit.
Evacuation Supplies Kit
Place in an easy-to-carry container the supplies you would most likely needif you were to be away from home for several days. Label the container
clearl y. Remember to include:
• Disaster Supplies Kit basics (listed ab ove).
• Three gallons of water per person.
• Three-day supply of nonperishable food.
• Kitchen accessories: manual can opener; mess kits or paper cups,plates, and plastic/disposable utensils; utility knife; a can of cookingfuel if food must be cooked; household liquid bleach to treat drinkingwater; suga r, salt, pepper; aluminum foil; plastic resealable bags.
• One complete change of clothing and footwear for each family membe r,
sturdy shoes or workboots, raingea r, hat and gl oves, thermal under-
wear, sunglasses.
• Blankets or sleeping bag for each family membe r.
• Tools and other accessories: pape r, pencil; needles and thread; pliers,
shut-off wrench, sh ovels, and other useful tools; tape; medicine dropper;
whistle; plastic sheeting; small caniste r, A-B-C-type fire extinguisher;
emergency preparedness manual; tube tent; compass.
•Sanitation and hygiene items: toilet pape r, tow-
elettes; soap, hand sanitize r, liquid detergent; femi-
nine supplies; personal items such as shampoo,deodorant, toothpast e, toothbrushes, comb and
brush, lip balm; plastic garbage bags (heavy-duty)and ties (for personal sanitation uses); medium-sized plastic bucket with tight lid; disinfectant;household chlorine bleach; small sh ovel for digging
an expedient latrine.
•Entertainment, such as games and books.

n For baby: formula, diapers, bottles, powdered milk, medications.
n For adults: heart and high blood pressure medication, insulin, pre-scription drugs, denture needs, contact lenses and supplies, extraeyeglasses, and hearing aid batteries.
Home Disaster Supplies Kit
In addition to your Disaster Supplies Kit basics and Evacuation Supplies Kit,gathering the following items will help your family endure home confine-ment, which often happens following disasters and may include the loss of utilities.• Wrench to turn off household gas and wate r. Keep it near the shut-off
valves.
• A week ’s supply of food and wate r.
• Additional blankets and sleeping bags.Also, consider using a N OAA Weather Radio with the tone-alert feature
in your home. N OAA Weather Radio is the best means for receiving warn-
ings from the National Weather Service.  The National Weather Service con-
tinuously broadcasts updated weather warnings and forecasts that can bereceived by N OAA Weather Radios sold in many stores. N OAA Weather
Radio now broadcasts warning and postevent information for all types ofhazards — both natural (such as earthquakes and volcanic activity) andtechnological (such as chemical releases or oil spills). Working with other
federal agencies and the Federal Communications Commission ’s new
Emergency Alert System, N OAA Weather Radio is an “all hazards” radio
network, making it the single source for the most comprehensive weatherand emergency information available to the public. Your National Weather
Service recommends purchasing a radio that has both a battery backup and a Specific Area Message Encoder (SAME) featur e, which automatically
alerts you when a watch or warning is issued for your count y, giving you
immediate information about a life-threatening situation. The averagerange is 40 miles, depending on topography; the National Weather Radio
signal is a line-of-sight signal, which does not bore through hills or mountains.
Water
Having an ample supply of clean water is a top priority in an emergenc y.
• Store water in plastic containers, su ch as soft drink plastic bo t-
tles.Seal containers tightl y, label them and store in a cool, dark place.
Replace water every six months. Avoid using containers that will
decompose or break, such as milk cartons or glass bottles.• Keep at least a th ree-day supply of water, or a minimum of
three gallons per person .It is strongly recommended to have more 
if possible. Use one-half gallon per day for drinking, and one-half gallonfor cooking and sanitation. A normally active person needs to drink atleast two quarts of water each da y. Hot e nvironments and intense phys-
ical activity can double that amount. Children, nursing mothers, and illpeople will need more. Store your three-day supply in a handy place.You need to have water packed and ready in case there is no time to 
fill water bottles when disaster strikes.
• Water needs to be t reated only if it is of questionable purit y. 
n Boiling is the safest method of treating wate r. Strain water through a
clean cloth to rem ove bulk impurities. Bring water to a rolling boil
for about one full minut e, keeping in mind that some water will
evaporate. Let the water cool before drinking. Boiled water will tastebetter if you put oxygen back into it by pouring the water back andforth between two clean containers. This will also impr ove the taste
of stored wate r.
n You can use household liquid bleach to kill microorganisms. Use
only regular household liquid bleach that contains 5.25 percent sodi-um hypochlorite. Do not use scented bleaches, color-safe bleaches,or bleaches with added cleaners. Add 16 drops of bleach per gallonof wate r, stir, and let stand for 30 minutes. If the water does not
have a slight bleach odo r, repeat the dosage and let stand another
15 minutes. If it still does not smell of chlorin e, discard it and find
another source of wate r. Other chemicals, such as iodine or water
treatment products sold in camping or surplus stores that do notcontain 5.25 percent hypochlorite as the only active ingredient, arenot recommended and should not be used.
n Distillation i nvolves boiling water and then collecting the vapor that
condenses back to wate r. The condensed vapor will not include salt
or other solid impurities. To distill, fill a pot halfway with wate r. Tie a
cup to the handle on the pot ’s lid so that the cup will hang rightside
up when the lid is upside down (make sure the cup is not touchingthe water) and boil the water for 20 minutes. The water that dripsfrom the lid into the cup is distilled.
• Melt ice cubes or use water f rom undamaged hot water tanks,
toilet tanks (not the b owl), and water pipes if you need addition-
al water.
• If you need to find water outside of your home, you can use
rainwater; st reams, ri vers, and  other m oving bodies of water;
ponds and la kes; and natu ral springs. If you question its purity,
Talking About Disaster: Guide for Standard Message s23Disaster Supplies Ki t 24be su re to t reat the water first .Avoid water with floating material,
an odo r, or a dark colo r. Use saltwater only if you distill it first. Do NOT
drink flood wate r.
Food 
Even though it is unlikely that an emergency would cut off your food supply for two weeks, you should consider preparing a supply that will lastthat long. The easiest way to develop a two-week stockpile is to increasethe amount of basic foods you normally keep on your shelves. If your watersupply is limited, try to avoid foods that are high in fat and protein, anddon’t stock salty foods, since they will make you thirst y. Familiar foods can
lift morale and give a feeling of security in time of stress. Also, cannedfoods won ’t require cooking, wate r, or special preparation. Take into
account your family ’s unique needs and tastes. Try to include foods that
they will enjoy and that are also high in calories, protein, carbohydrates,vitamins, and minerals.• Pack at least a th ree-day supply of nonperishable food and
water, and sto re it in a han dy place. You need to have these items
packed and ready in case there is no time to gather food from thekitchen when disaster strikes.
• Select foods that require no refrige ration, p reparation, or 
cooking, and little or no water. Foods that a re compact and
lightweight a re easy to sto re and carr y.
• If you must heat food, pa ck a can of cooking fuel. 
• Try to eat salt-f ree crackers, whole g rain ce reals, and canned
food with high liquid content .Recommended foods include:
n Ready-to-eat canned meats, fruits, and vegetables.
n Canned juic e, milk, and soup (if powdered, store extra water).
n High-energy foods, such as  peanut butte r, jelly, crackers, granola
bars, and trail mix.
n Comfort foods, such as hard cand y, sweetened cereals, candy bars,
and cookies.
n Instant coffe e, tea bags.
n Foods for infants, elderly persons, or persons on special diets, if necessar y.
Also consider:
n Compressed food bars. They store well, are lightweight, taste good,and are nutritious.
n Trail mix. Available prepackaged, or assemble your own.n Dried foods. They can be nutritious and satisfying, but contain a lotof salt, which promotes thirst.
n Freeze-dried foods. They are tasty and lightweight, but will needwater for reconstitution.
n Instant meals. Cups of noodles or cups of soup are a good addition,although they need water for reconstitution.
n Snack-sized canned goods. Good because they generally have pull-top lids or twist-open keys.
n Prepackaged beverages. Those in foil packets and foil-lined boxesare suitable because they are tightly sealed and will keep for a long time.
Food options to avoid:
n Commercially dehydrated foods. They can require a great deal of water for reconstitution and extra effort in preparation.
n Bottled foods. They are generally too heavy and bulk y, and break
easily.
n Meal-sized canned foods. They are usually bulky and heav y.
n Whole grains, beans, pasta. Preparation could be complicated underthe circumstances of a disaste r.
• If your electricity goes off:
n First, use perishable food and foods f rom the refrige rator.
n Then, use the foods f rom the f reezer.To minimize the number
of times you open the freezer doo r, post a list of freezer contents on
it. In a well-filled, well-insulated freeze r, foods will usually still have
ice crystals in their centers (meaning foods are safe to eat) for atleast three days.
n Finall y, begin to use nonperishable foods and staples.
• Remember to sto re nonperishable foods for your pets.
First Aid Kit
Assemble a first aid kit for your Disaster Supplies Kit and 
one for ea ch car.
• The basics for your first aid kit include:
n First aid manual.
n Sterile adhesive bandages in assorted sizes.
n Assorted sizes of safety pins.
n Cleansing agent/soap.
Talking About Disaster: Guide for Standard Message s25Disaster Supplies Ki t 26n Latex gl oves (2 pairs).
n Sunscreen.
n 2-inch sterile gauze pads (4–6).
n 4-inch sterile gauze pads (4–6).
n Triangular bandages (3).
n Nonprescription drugs.
n 2-inch sterile roller bandages (3 rolls).
n 3-inch sterile roller bandages (3 rolls).
n Scissors.
n Tweezers.
n Needle.
n Moistened towelettes.
n Antiseptic.
n Thermomete r.
n Tongue depressor blades (2).
n Tube of petroleum jelly or other lubricant.
• Have the following nonp rescription drugs in your Disaster
Supplies Kit:
n Aspirin or nonaspirin pain relieve r.
n Antidiarrhea medication.
n Antacid (for stomach upset).
n Syrup of ipecac (use to induce vomiting if advised by the poison control center).
n Laxative.
n Activated charcoal (use if advised by the poison control center).
n Vitamins.
• Add a ny necessary p rescription and nonp rescription drugs.
• Add special needs for infants, elderly persons, or a nyone with
serious alle rgies.
Important Documents 
• Keep the following original documents in a sa fe deposit box
if possible, and copies in a waterp roof, fi re-resistant portable 
container:
n Will, insurance policies, contracts, deeds, stocks and bonds.n Passports, social security cards, immunization records. 
n Bank account numbers.
n Credit card account numbers and companies.
n Inventory of valuable household goods, important telephone
numbers.
n Family records (birth, marriag e, death certifica tes).

EARTHQUAKE PREPAREDNESS 
BEFORE, DURING AND AFTER 
 
 
 
Earthquakes are common in BC and more t han 1,200 are recorded each year across the 
province.  
 
The coast of BC is considered to be a high-risk earthquake zone. In this region, tectonic 
plates are moving apart, sliding past one another and colliding. It is t he movement of these 
plates that causes small ear thquakes (daily), potentially  damaging earthquakes (decades 
apart), and some of the world’s lar gest earthquakes (centuries apart).  
Earthquakes strike without warning, so it is  important to act now to get prepared.  
 
Before the Shaking Starts  
 
Prepare Your Family  
• Know the safe spots in each room ― against inside walls, under sturdy tables, desks or 
archways.  
• Know the danger spots ― windows, mirrors, hanging obje cts, fireplaces and tall, 
unsecured furniture.  
• Practice family drills. Physically place yourse lf in safe locations. This is especially 
important for children.  
• Learn first aid and CPR.  
• Keep a listing of emergency numbers.  
• Prepare a family emergency kit with supplies for at least 72 hours.  
 
Prepare Your Home  
• Learn how to shut off gas , water and electricity.  
• Keep breakables or heavy objects on bottom shelves.  
• Secure tall heavy furniture which could toppl e, such as bookcases, china cabinets or 
wall units.  
• Secure the water heater and appliances.  
• Secure hanging plants and heavy picture frames  or mirrors (especially over beds).  
• Put latches on cabinet doors to hold closed during shaking.  
• Keep flammable or hazardous liquids such as paints, pest sprays or cleaning products 
in the garage or outside shed.  
• Check chimneys, roofs, walls, foundat ions for structural condition.  
• Maintain emergency food, water and other supplies, including flashlight, a portable 
battery-operated radio, extra batteries, medicines, first aid kit and clothing.  
 During the Shaking  
• If indoors, stay there. Dr op, cover and hold. Get under a desk or table and hang on. 
Alternately, you can stand in an archway or corner.  
• If outdoors, get into an open area away from  trees, buildings, walls and power lines.  
• If in a high-rise building, stay away from  windows and outside walls. Get under a table. 
Do not use the elevators.  
• If driving, pull your car to the side of the road and stop. Avoid overpasses or power 
lines. Remain inside until the shaking is over.  
• If in a crowded public place, do not rush for the doors. Move away from display shelves 
containing objects that may fall.  
• In all instances, drop, cover and hold; protect your head as much as possible.  
 
After the Shaking Stops  
• Stay calm and check for injuries. Apply first aid if qualified. Do not  move any seriously 
injured individuals unless they are in immediate danger.  
• Check for fires, gas and water leaks and damaged electrical wiring or sewer lines.  
• If you smell gas, do not use matches, candl es, etc. and do not operate electrical 
switches.  
• Check building for cracks and damage, includ ing roof, chimneys an d foundation. If you 
suspect there is serious damage, turn off all utilities and leave the building.  
• Check food and water supplies. Emergency water may be obtained from water heaters, 
melted ice cubes, toilet tanks and canned vegetables.  
• Seek sources of uncontaminated water. In  an emergency, purify water by straining 
through a paper towel or several layers of clean cloth and by boiling vigorously for at 
least six minutes.  
• Do not use BBQ’s, camp stov es or unvented heaters indoors.  
• Do not flush toilet if sewer line is damaged.  
• Do not use the telephone unless there is a severe injury or  fire to report.  
• Turn on your portable radio for instructions and news reports, and cooperate fully with 
public safety officials.  
• Keep Disaster Response Routes clear for emergency vehicles.  
• Be prepared for aftershocks.  
 
Movement of the ground is seld om the actual cause of death or injury. Most casualties 
result from partial building collapse, falling objects and d ebris, like toppling chimneys, 
ceiling plaster and light fixtures.  
 
Remember –  
Stay calm and lend a hand to others in need.

"Emergency Food For Babies 
Infants and very small children would be the first victim s of starvation during and after a pandemic, unless special 
preparations are made on their behalf. They need food s that are more concent rated and less rough. Most 
American mothers do not nurse their infants, and if a fa mily's supply of baby foods were exhausted the parents 
might experience the agony of seeing their baby slowly starve . Under unsanitary conditions, it is safer to make a 
formula 3 times a day. To do so, add 1/3 cup plus 2 teaspoo ns (a little less than one ounce) of instant nonfat milk 
powder to 1-1/3 cups (2/3 pint) of boiled water, and st ir thoroughly. Then add 1 tablespoon (about 1/3 ounce, or 9 
grams) of vegetable oil and 2 teaspoons of sugar, and st ir. (If regular bakers' milk powder is used, 1/4 cup is 
enough when making one-third of the daily formula, 3 time s a day.) If baby bottles are not at hand, milk can be 
spoon-fed to an infant. 
During a crisis, the best and most dependable food for an inf ant is mother's milk provided the mother is assured 
an adequate diet. The possibility of disaster is one more  reason why a mother should nurse her baby for a full 
year. Storing additional high-protein foods and fats for a nursing mother usually will be better insurance against 
her infant getting sick or starving than keeping adequate stocks of baby foods and the equipment necessary for 
sanitary feeding after evacuation or an attack. 
To give a daily vitamin supplement to a baby, a multivitamin pill should be crushed to a fine powder between two 
spoons and dissolved in a small amount of fluid, so t hat the baby can easily swallow it. If an infant does not 
receive adequate amounts of vitamins A, D, and C, he will develop deficiency symptoms in 1 to 3 months, 
depending on the amounts stored in his body. Vitamin C def iciency, the first to appear, can be prevented by 
giving an infant 15 mg of vitamin C each day (about 1/3 of a 50-mg vitamin C tablet, pulverized) or customary 
foods containing vitamin C, such as orange juice. 
Lacking these sources, the juice squeezed from sprouted grains or legumes can be used. If no vitamin pills or 
foods rich in vitamin D are available, exposure of the baby's skin to sunlight will cause his body to produce vitamin 
D. If sufficient milk is not obtainable, even infants younger  than six months should be given solid food. Solid foods 
for babies must be pureed to a fine texture. Using a m odern baby food grinder makes pureeing quick and easy 
work. Under crisis conditions, a grinder should be cleaned and disinfected like other baby-feeding utensils, as 
described later in this section. Several expedient methods ar e available: the food can be pressed through a sieve, 
mashed with a fork or spoon, or squeezed through a porous cloth. Good sanitation must be maintained; all foods 
should be brought to a boil after pureeing to in sure that the food is safe from bacteria. 
A pureed solid baby food can be made by first boiling togethe r 3 parts of a cereal grain and 1 part of beans until 
they are soft. Then the mixture should be pressed through a siev e. The sieve catches t he tough hulls from the 
grain kernels and the skins from the beans. The grain-beans combination will provide needed calories and a well-
supplemented protein. The beans also supply the additional  iron that a baby needs by the time he is 6 months 
old. Flours made from whole grains or beans, as previ ously described, also can be used; however, these may 
contain more rough material. Some grains are preferable to  others. It is easier to sieve cooked corn kernels than 
cooked wheat kernels. Since wheat is the grain most likely  to cause allergies, it should not be fed to an infant until 
he is 6 to 7 months old if other grains, such as rice or corn, are available. Small children also need more protein 
than can be supplied by grains alone. 
As a substitute for milk, some bean food should be provided at  every meal. If the available diet is deficient in a 
concentrated energy source such as fat or sugar, a child's feedings should be increased to 4 or 5 times a day, to enable him to assimilate more. Whenever possible, a small ch ild should have a daily diet that contains at least 
one ounce of fat (3 tablespoons, without scraping the spoon). This would provide more than 10% of a young 
child's calories in the form of fat, which would be beneficial. 
If under emergency conditions it is not practical to boil inf ant feeding utensils, they can be sterilized with a bleach 
solution. Add one teaspoon of ordinary household bleach to a quart of water. (Ordinary household bleach 
contains 5.25% sodium hypochlorite as its only active  ingredient and supplies approximately 5% available 
chlorine. If the strength of the bleach is unknown, add 3 teaspoons per quart.) Directions for safe feeding without 
boiling follow: 
  Utensils  
1. Immediately after feeding, wash the inside and outsid e of all utensils used to prepare the formula and to 
feed the infant. 
2. Fill a covered container with clean, cold wate r and add the appropriate amount of chlorine bleach. 
3. Totally immerse all utensils until the next feeding (3 or  4 hours). Be sure that the bottle, if used, is filled 
with bleach solution. Keep container covered. 
At feeding time: Wash hands before preparing food. Remove  utensils from the disinfectant chlorine solution and 
drain, but do not rinse or dry. Prepare formula; feed th e baby. Immediately after feeding: Wash utensils in clean 
water and immerse again in the disinfectant solution. Prepare fresh chlorine solution each day.

" ""Militia Cookbook"" Emergency Food Preparation
Page 1 of 37Emergency Food Preparation
During wartime or a natural disaster, food shortages and lack of natural gas or electricity for
cooking requires a great deal of improvisation and reliance upon back-to-basics cookingtechniques used by our forefathers in order to survive.  In an emergency it helps to know what to
do with all the wheat, rice, cornmeal, sugar, molasses, vegetable oil and dried beans, milk, fruits
and vegetables which you've wisely cached along with firewood or cooking fuel.
Colonial, pioneer and nineteenth century military cooking methods and recipes are useful when
preparing meals from simple cached staples.  Many of the recipes included in this informationpaper don't need perishables like meat, eggs or yeast, which you might not have.
Recipes for the modern kitchen with a temperature-controlled oven will naturally have to be
adjusted by trial and error if you are baking in a clay oven in the field or cooking over a campfire.
Improvisation is called for to substitute what is available.  For example if a recipe calls for bacon
drippings, you can use any cooking fat like lard, margarine, butter, vegetable oil or shortening.
Butter Flavor Crisco can be used in most recipes, doesn't require refrigeration and is available in
easy to measure sticks.
The interaction between a sweetener, baking soda and buttermilk or sour milk (which you can
make by adding a little vinegar to reconstituted dry milk; 1 tablespoon per cup of milk and let
stand 5 minutes) can substitute for yeast if none is available.
White hardwood ashes can replace baking powder as a leavening agent.Honey, molasses or syrups and be substituted for sugar in most recipes by using less water.  1 cup
honey = 1-1/4 cup sugar plus 1/4 cup liquid.
Use whatever dried fruit is available regardless of what the recipe calls for.
Experimentation is the order of the day.If you remember to add spices in stages (they can't be removed if you use too much) and if all of
the ingredients you use are food, then the chances are the end result will be edible (especially if
you are hungry enough). ""Militia Cookbook"" Emergency Food Preparation

""Piggin' Out in Dixie"" (Southern Cookbooks, P.O.  Box 100905, Nashville, TN 37224).
Recipes and field cooking techniques have also been excerpted from ""The Green Beret Gourmet""
(The Guttenberg Press Publications, P.O.  Box 973, Rockledge, FL 32955).
Some quick bread recipes which don't require yeast come from ""Sunset Breads"" (Sunset

You should have a camping stove for emergency cooking purposes.  Two-burner stoves are useful
in a fixed location or if you are vehicle mobile.  Propane stoves are easy to use but fuel is
expensive, the high pressure steel canisters are heavy and not likely to be widely available duringa long-term emergency.  A multifuel stove capable of using either white gas (lantern fuel orColeman fuel) or ordinary gasoline is easier to resupply in an emergency.  However, gasolineburns hotter than propane and is not as useful for low heat simmering of foods, so it might be wiseto have both types of stove.
If you are in a fixed location like a survival retreat or base camp, nothing beats a cast iron skillet,
covered kettle and especially a dutch oven for open fire or hot coal cooking.  An excellentconfiguration for a cooking fire is the keyhole type.  Build a fire ring of rocks with a rectangularextension, build a fire in the circular part and coals can be raked or shoveled into the rectangularcooking area as needed.  A grill or griddle can be supported over the rectangular cooking area
(bricks can be used instead of rocks here for more stability) or the area can be used with a dutch
oven.  A metal tripod (or one fashioned from green branches) to hang a kettle can be used forboiling water or directly cooking over the flames in the circular part of the fire ring.
The book ""Roughing It Easy"" shows how useful heavy duty aluminum foil is for out door cooking;
stock up.  Also, if you store food in large #10 cans (1 gallon) or in five gallon square cans, get this
book and a pair of tin snips to convert the empty cans into many useful stove and oven variations.A cookie cooling rack can be used over a small pit of coals or an improvised #10 can barbecue.
A grill and dutch oven can be arranged to allow simultaneous use as a baking oven and for frying.
Dig a shallow hole 9 to 12 inches in diameter and 3 to 4 inches deep; place coals or charcoal
briquets in the hole and place the grill across the hole; put the pan containing the item to be baked
on the grill and cover with an inverted dutch oven; place coals on the base of the dutch oven whichis now the top; place the inverted dutch oven lid on the base tripod legs and it becomes a griddlefor frying foods.
Another useful accessory for either base camp cooking or for use in the field is a folding pack
grill.  Such a grill can be used for directly broiling meats, as a stand over the coals for a skillet,
griddle or a stock pot (used for soups and stews, as a steamer or as an oven for baking or roasting),as a reflector oven (using disposable aluminum cooking pans for reflectors), as a stand for aninverted dutch oven lid allowing it to be used for frying, as a dirt free stand for placing a dutchoven lid when adding ingredients to or checking the progress of food in the oven and as a standaway from the fire for serving or for safely adding ingredients without burning yourself or spilling
the food.  The Coghlan's brand pack grill is cheap enough (about $3 to $4 in discount stores) that
several can be purchased for use in a base camp.  A single pack grill and a lightweight nestingcooking set or GI mess kit can be carried in your rucksack to simplify field cooking.
You can also add a folding pocket stove or GI canteen cup stand and solid fuel tablets to your
rucksack for reheating prepared foods or preparing hot beverages like instant soup, coffee, tea or
cocoa.
To ease the cleanup chore when reheating cooked food, immerse the food container (can, MRE
pouch, vacuum seal bag or freezer bag) in boiling water in your cooking pot; pierce the foodcontainer above the water line so it doesn't explode.  In the field this method of heating food
reduces cooking odors and lessens the chance of giving away your unit's position to enemy scouts.
A single-burner butane or multifuel backpacking stove can be shared between two or three people.
Most butane cartridges nowadays are filled with iso-butane which can be used down to about 20degrees but, like with two-burner camp stoves, a multifuel stove is easier to resupply.  Get an extraGI canteen cover and you can carry your stove attached to the side of your GI rucksack. ""Militia Cookbook"" Emergency Food Preparation
Page 4 of 37If you are on the move without a vehicle or pack animals to carry heavy cooking vessels like cast
iron skillets and dutch ovens (or in case you get separated from your well stocked rucksack), here
are some of the many other ways of cooking food using natural materials described in ""The Green
Beret Gourmet"":
Clay Ovens:
Construct an arched structure of green sticks (similar in shape to a beehive), insert a thick stick
vertically through the top to form a flue opening and daub with wet clay until it is completely
covered except for a front opening.  Pile on successive layers of clay until a thick wall is made.
Allow the layers to dry between applications by either placing hot coals inside or, if time is not aproblem, by the sun.  If each layer is not thoroughly dry, the oven will crack when you try to useit.  A clay oven can also be made by hammering a thick sharpened stick down through a bank orslope about three feet back from the edge.  Scoop out the size of the oven you want about a foot orso down the bank.  Leave a thick ceiling.  Leave a narrow front opening and dig back and hollow
the bank as far as the stick which you hammered down.  Pull the stick out to form the chimney
opening.  Wet your hands and smooth the interior surfaces, then harden the walls by building asmall fire inside.  After your oven is prepared, to use it build a fire inside.  When the fire hasburned down, scrape out the coals and ashes.  Lay food inside on stones, leaves or hardwood slabs.Close off the front opening and flue.  Leave food inside to cook.  Cooking time depends upon thetype of food being cooked.
Cooking in Natural Containers:
A stone with a hollow in it makes an excellent container.  If it is small enough you can build a fire
around the stone.  Bark can be used to fashion pots to boil water, cook soups, stews or any foodswith liquids over a fire.  Peel a square of bark and fold the corners inward and hold them in place
with wooden pegs.  Keep the flames from touching your bark pot above the liquid level and your
meal will cook in this simple container.  Large leaves make an instant ""aluminum foil"" whenbaking or steaming food, but be sure to use edible nonpoisonous leaves.
Baking in Clay.
This method is excellent for small game or fish.  Remove the entrails from the animal being
prepared.  This is easiest to do if the animal is already dead.  Do not skin, pluck or scale.  Cover
with a layer of clay about an inch thick.  Place it in hot ashes and build a fire above it.  Cookingtime varies with animal size and taste preference.  A one pound animal will be cooked inapproximately 30 to 40 minutes.  The meat will be stripped clean of fur, feathers or scales whenyou break off the clay.
Baking on a Stick.
Heat a peeled green stick by the fire while you prepare a bread dough.  Mix a GI canteen cup of
flour with a mound of baking powder the size of a quarter and a dash of salt.  Add water graduallyto make a soft dough.  Work quickly so the bread will rise as it bakes.  Wrap dough around heatedstick and place upright next to the fire to let it bake.
Cooking in Ashes.
Foodstuff is placed in warm ashes and then covered with embers.  Self-contained foods such as
vegetables do not need to be wrapped in anything; simply place them in the ashes and dust themoff after cooking.  Cooking time depends upon the type of food and personal preferences.  Youcan test vegetables by feeling for softness and putting them back if they still feel firm.
Cooking on Wood Slabs.
Select a green hardwood slab (evergreens season the food with a pine or turpentine taste) large
enough to lash or peg the animal.  Fish and very small game can be successfully cooked this way.Clean the animal and flatten down on the slab.  Either pin the animal down with wooden pegs orlash to the slab with whatever is available.  Lean the slab up in front of glowing coals.  Turn a few
times so the food will cook evenly. ""Militia Cookbook"" Emergency Food Preparation
Page 5 of 37This recipe comes from Richmond, Virginia in the Confederate States of America when Yankee
invaders were marauding and food was in short supply:
Roasted Rat
The rat must be skinned, cleaned, his head cut off and his body laid upon a square board, the legs
stretched to their full extent and secured upon it with small tacks, then baste with bacon fat androast before a good fire quickly like canvasback ducks.
Broiling on a Stick.
This is a good method for cooking a small amount of food.  Fish, birds and small animals (large
animals must be cut into smaller chunks) can be cleaned and then skewered on a peeled greenwood stick.  If the food tends to slide, a bark twine can be used to tie it down by splitting the wooddown to the game on both ends and twisting bark through the splits.  Sear the meat in the flame toseal in the juices.  The skewer can be laid over forked green sticks at both ends of an ember bed.
As long as the fire does not flame up, the meat needs only occasional turning so it cooks evenly.
Steaming in a Hole.
This method can be used to cook small or enormous amounts of food with great results.  Build a
fire and place some stones in it to heat.  Don't select rocks from a stream bed, limestone orsandstone since they can contain trapped moisture and may explode when heated.  While the
stones are heating, dig a hole.  Put the stones in the pit and place a thick layer of wet vegetation
like grass or seaweed over them.  Lay the food on top of the wet vegetation and place a stick nearthe edge of the pit.  Fill with dirt.  Pull the stick out and pour water down this opening onto therocks to steam the food.  Tamp down the top and leave the food to steam for at least two or threehours.  If you are cooking something larger than fish or small game, the cooking time will need to
be extended.
Grilling
Meat can be grilled over the coals if it is fat.  Lean game will end up very dry.  Build a bed of
hardwood embers and place a grill matting of green sticks on it.  Place the meat on the grill andturn immediately after the sides are seared to seal in the juices.  Try not to pierce the meat with
whatever you are turning it with so you don't lose any juices.  Keep a small container of water
nearby to douse any flames that surface from the fat drippings. ""Militia Cookbook"" Emergency Food Preparation
Page 6 of 37Fire Cake and Hoe Cakes
One of the easiest ways of making flour edible, even if not very appetizing, is to make a simple
dough and fry or bake it over a fire.  During the Revolutionary War it was common for soldiers to
make a thick paste of flour and water (salt was added when available) and then bake it on hotrocks around a campfire.  The result was an unpalatable, chewy, soggy glob which only thestarving soldiers at Valley Forge probably appreciated.  Hoe cakes were made from a corn mealdough carried to the fields by slaves and other farm workers.  At lunch they cleaned their hoes, putthe dough on them and cooked it over a fire.
Entrenching Tool Cake
4 GI canteen cups white cornmeal

Scald cornmeal with enough boiling water to make a stiff batter, then add bacon drippings and
salt.  Shape into pones, leaving the imprint of four fingers across top.  Place batter on the cleaned,greased blade of an entrenching tool and set up next to fire to bake.
Corn Pone
2 cups cornmeal

over glowing coals. ""Militia Cookbook"" Emergency Food Preparation
Page 7 of 37Hardtack
During the War for Southern Independence, hardtack was a staple food (when fresh bread was
unavailable) for both the brutal soldiers of the oppressive Federal government and the brave
Confederate patriots defending their homeland.  Hardtack was a virtually indestructible 1/2-inchthick cracker about three inches by three inches, pierced with sixteen holes and made from flourand water.  Tack was a contemptuous term for food and the soldiers ""affectionately"" referred tohardtack as worm castles, sheet iron crackers and tooth dullers.  Some of the hardtack issued tosoldiers in the 1860's was supposedly left over from the 1846-48 Mexican War.  The daily ration
was nine or ten crackers, but there was usually enough for those who wanted more since some
men would not draw a full ration.  They were eaten plain, soaked in coffee or crumbled and addedto the stew pot.  A dish known as Skillygalee was made by soaking hardtack in cold water andthen browning it in pork fat and seasoning to taste.  A favorite seasoning of the times was cayennepepper.  Confederate Cush provided a dinner entree that consisted of bits of cooked beef, seasonedwith garlic, fried in bacon grease and then stewed with crumbled hardtack or cornmeal mush.  The
crackers included in military C-rations and the current MREs are similar to hardtack, being much
more dense, containing more flour and less air than commercial saltine crackers.  When fresh,hardtack was not unappetizing, but when boxes of hardtack sat on railroad platforms orwarehouses for months before being issued it hardened and often became insect infested.  Becausehardtack was packed in boxes marked ""B.C."" (probably for ""Brigade Commissary""), soldiers said
they were so hard because they were baked ""Before Christ"".
The following account from a Yankee invader indicates how much hardtack was appreciated:
""While before Petersburg, doing siege work in the summer of 1864, our men had wormy hardtack,or ship's biscuit, served out to them for a time.  It was a severe trial, and it tested the temper of themen.  Breaking open the biscuit and finding live worms in them, they would throw the pieces in
the trenches where they were doing duty day by day, although the orders were to keep the trenches
clean for sanitary reasons.  A brigade officer of the day, seeing some of the scraps along our front,called out sharply to our men 'Throw that hardtack out of the trenches.' Then, as the men menpromptly gathered it up as directed, he added, 'Don't you know that you've no business to throwhardtack in the trenches? Haven't you been told that often enough?' Out from the injured soldierheart there came the reasonable explanation 'We've thrown it out two or three times, sir, but it
crawls back.'""
Hardtack (original 1860's recipe)  Use one part water to six parts flour.  Roll dough flat and score
into cracker shapes.  Bake 20-25 minutes and cool off until completely dry before storing incanisters.  The crackers should be hard as bricks and indestructibly unappetizing.  If not consumedby hungry soldiers, the crackers might last at least until the Lord returns!
The following recipes don't duplicate the indestructible nature of 19th century hardtack, but they
are more appetizing since they are made from more than just flour and water:
Corntack
1-1/4 cups cornmeal
1 cup water (about)1/2 tsp.  salt2 tbsp.  vegetable oilCombine the above ingredients, using enough water to moisten.  Bake in a greased 7x11-inch panat 375 degrees for around 15 minutes, or until the edges begin to brown slightly.  While still warm,
cut into squares.  A modern day cross between hardtack and cornbread, these thick crackers are
actually pleasantly tasty served warm or reheated. ""Militia Cookbook"" Emergency Food Preparation

Red meats are complete proteins containing all of the essential amino acids needed by the body to
build and maintain muscle and other tissues.  Most vegetables don't contain all of the necessary
amino acids (although soybeans contain most) and are referred to as incomplete proteins.  TheConfederate army marched and fought on a staple diet of cornbread and beans, combiningincomplete proteins to provide good nutrition.

Page 13 of 37Beans
There is an old saying, ""Beans, beans, good for the heart, the more you eat beans the more your
health will improve."" All varieties of dried beans except split peas and lentils need to be soaked
before cooking.  Beans tend to retain their shape better with a long soak.
Cooking Dried Beans.
To prepare dried beans (1 pound of dried beans = about 2 cups raw or 5 to 6 cups cooked), place
washed beans in a pot with 2 to 3 times their volume of water (1 pound of beans needs 4 to 6
cups).  Let stand 8 to 12 hours.  To quick soak, bring water and beans to a boil and allow to boil 2
minutes.  Cover pot and let stand 1 hour.  The time required for cooking beans is generally 1-1/2to 2 hours, but this depends upon the variety of bean and the length of time they have been stored.Check beans often as they begin to get tender so they don't get mushy.  Cook at a gentle simmerwith the lid tilted to retain shape.  If beans foam up during cooking, add a tablespoon of oil or fatto the water or cook with a small amount of fat pork or bacon.  If a recipe calls for tomatoes,
lemon juice or vinegar, add when beans are almost tender or acid will slow the softening process.
Beans can also be prepared for quick-cooking in camp like minute rice.  Cook them normally untiltender, drain and dry them in a food dryer or spread them on a flat pan and dry in a warm oven orin the sun.  Store in airtight canisters.  They can then be reconstituted in water by boiling about 20minutes.

Page 15 of 37Rice and Beans
Like the cornbread and beans diet of the Confederacy or the fish and rice staple diet of the Orient,
rice and beans combine incomplete proteins from two different foods to form complete proteins.
The combination of rice and beans is a staple diet for much of the world's population.  You can topthe Carolina Red Rice recipe with cooked dried beans (seasoned to taste).  Use the recipes forHopping John (a colonial dish served on New Year's Day to insure good luck) as guidelines andsubstitute whatever type of beans you have available.  Try adding canned chili and tomato sauceor salsa to cooked rice (or make your own chili with meat, tomato sauce and chili seasonings) and
add it to any rice and bean mix (seasoned to taste with hot sauce).
Cooking Rice
Instant or minute rice, while good for cooking in the field, won't store for long periods (without
vacuum or nitrogen packing) since it has already been cooked and then dried.  To prepare regularlong grain white rice (1 cup uncooked rice = about 3 cups cooked rice), rinse lightly and drain the
water.  Add one cup of water and 1/2 to 1 tsp.  salt (or meat stock or bouillon) for each cup of rice.
Optionally, add one teaspoon of butter or oil for each cup of uncooked rice.  Bring to a boil overhigh heat and allow to boil one minute.  Cover pot, reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes.Remove from heat and let stand for 10 minutes more.  Don't open lid while cooking.
Bean-Rice Casserole
3 cups water
1 cup uncooked rice1/2 cup quick-cooking black beans (see previous section for instructions on preparing quick-cooking beans or substitute cooked dried beans or a can of cooked beans)1 tbsp.  instant beef bouillon
3 tbsp.  margarine
1/2 cup chopped dried apricots1/2 cup chopped dried pineapplePut all ingredients in a frying pan and mix.  Cover and cook over medium heat for about 20minutes.  Don't stir while it's cooking because that will make the rice gummy.  When the water hasbeen absorbed, test rice for doneness.  If it's still a little chewy, add a little more water and cook a
few minutes more.

Page 17 of 37Bread and Biscuits
In case of a power outage, bread bakes just as well in a dutch oven with hot coals or charcoal
briquets (cooking time should be roughly the same as in your home oven).  If you don't do a lot of
baking, you might want to invest in a set of no-stick air-bake insulated baking pans and cookiesheets, which will lessen the chance of burning your baked goods.  Bread can be prepared fromstockpiled staples and can be served with any meal.  However, note that due to their oil content,items like wheat germ and whole wheat flour or other unprocessed flours will turn rancid withoutrefrigeration (or freezing).  It's best to store whole grains, get a hand cranked mill and grind your
own flour.  In the face of an expected long-term power outage, you will want to preserve or use up
the perishables in your refrigerator.  Baking bread is a good way to use your milk, eggs and butter(substitute melted butter in recipes that call for vegetable oil) before they spoil and will give yousomething to put your peanut butter and jelly on or sop up some gravy.  To ease this task, you maywant to keep a stock of Jiffy Muffin Mix on hand (rotate periodically by using and replacing).These mixes are easy to use and are very versatile.  For example, the corn muffin mix package has
instructions for preparing as muffins, cornbread, corn sticks and corn pancakes or waffles.  Any
Jiffy Muffin Mix can be extended using the following recipe:
Jiffy Muffin Mix Mini-Loaves
1 package Jiffy Muffin Mix (corn muffin, blueberry, apple-cinnamon, etc.)
In addition to the ingredients listed in package recipe (e.g.  corn muffins call for 1 egg and 1/3 cup
milk), also use:1/3 cup wheat germ, bran or uncooked multigrain cereal1 tbsp.  brown sugar or molasses1/4 tsp.  salt1/3 cup raisins or chopped dried fruit (or 1/4 cup each dried fruit & chopped nuts)
1/2 tsp.  baking powder
1 tbsp.  melted butter or vegetable oil1 tbsp.  milkFor corn muffin mix, preheat oven to 400 degrees (or temperature called for by other type muffinmix).  Mix dry ingredients together.  Beat remaining ingredients together in a separate bowl, thenblend with dry mix.  For maximum rise, let batter rest 3 or 4 minutes and then pour into two
greased 3x5-1/2 inch mini-loaf pans (which will fit in a 10-inch dutch oven, by the way; set the
pans on top of home-canning jar rings or pebbles placed in the bottom of the oven to let hot aircirculate under the pans).  Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until brown.
The following quick breads (no active dry yeast required) can also be prepared to use up your
milk, eggs and butter before they spoil:
Logan Bread
6 eggs
3 cups flour (any mixture of whole wheat and rye)3/4 cup wheat germ
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup powdered milk1 cup oil1/2 cup honey1/4 cup molasses1/4 cup sorghum syrup or maple syrup
(any combination of these four sweeteners totaling one cup works fine)
1/2 cup shelled walnuts or pecans1 cup dried fruit (raisins, dates, apricots, peaches, etc.)Beat all the ingredients together in a large bowl.  Pat down into two greased 9x5-inch loaf pans.Bake at 275 degrees for two hours, or until a tester comes out clean.  The bread will be veryheavy, dense and chewy; each loaf weighs 24 ounces.  Logan bread tastes good on the trail, is high
in calories and is almost impervious to spoilage. ""Militia Cookbook"" Emergency Food Preparation

Page 23 of 37Casseroles, Soups, Stews and Dumplings
Much colonial cooking consisted of meals that simmered for hours in cast iron kettles over the
fireplace.  One-pot meals in a dutch oven or iron kettle over a fire are still a practical method for
preparing a lot of food with minimum effort.  For casseroles the ingredients are mixed together inthe cooking vessel and then baked.  For soups and stews on the stove top or over the fire, the meatgoes in first and vegetables are added towards the end of the cooking time.  If unexpected guestsshow up, an extra potato can be quartered and dropped in the stew pot.  If meat is in short supplyfor your stew, you can substitute bouillon cubes and a little butter or vegetable oil and add
potatoes or dumplings.  Dumplings can be quickly prepared to stretch a meal by adding biscuit
dough in small lumps or strips and steaming in the covered pot for 10 to 15 minutes (either use abiscuit recipe from the previous section or try one of the dumpling recipes below).
Whole Wheat Biscuit Mix for Dumplings

Combine at home and store in a zip-lock bag or Nalgene bottle.  In camp, add 3 tablespoons water
per 1/2 cup biscuit mix and mix well.  Spoon into boiling stew or soup.  Simmer 10 minutesuncovered and 10 minutes covered.
Cornmeal Dumplings
1 cup cornmeal
1/4 tsp.  black pepper
ham stockMix cornmeal and pepper.  While ham stock is boiling, pour some over meal mixture and stir intodough.  Make stiff enough to form balls the size of an egg and drop in briskly boiling stock.Reduce heat and simmer 20 minutes.
Dumplings
4 cups flour
1/3 cup lard or other shortening1-1/2 to 2 cups waterMix together flour and lard.  Add water and mix thoroughly.  Toss dough on a floured surfaceuntil coated with flour.  Divide into 4 balls and roll dough out 1 ball at a time to about 1/4-inch or
thinner.  Cut in strips and cut strips into 2-inch pieces.  Add a few pieces at a time to boiling broth.
Cook uncovered, making sure that each dumpling is under the liquid part of the time.  cook about5 to 10 minutes.  Makes 4 to 5 large servings.  (Note: If using self rising flour, make sure to usehot water so dough will rise before cooking.) ""Militia Cookbook"" Emergency Food Preparation

The complex carbohydrates in bread and pasta can take four hours for the body to break down and
make use of.  This is fine to provide energy for a long hike or to allow you to sleep warmly.  The
carbohydrates in simple sugars are more easily assimilated by the body (about fifteen minutes).Cookies or breads containing fruit and a high sugar content make good snacks for a quick pick-me-up on the trail.  For example, most of recipes in the cornbread section can be prepared using alittle extra brown sugar, molasses and some raisins.  Cooking the sugar rich cornbread batter in acast iron corn stick pan makes an excellent trail snack or something to munch on in a sniper hide.
To satisfy your sweet tooth and to provide quick energy, here are some recipes that use sugar
(brown sugar is easier to carry and use in the field), molasses and dried or fresh fruits (there is apossibility that you might just happen to run across a couple of apples in Washington State):

Most Americans have an aversion to eating dogs, cats or horse meat while they don't give a second
thought to eating a piece of chicken, beef or pork.  It's also a culinary taboo to eat vermin like rats
and groundhogs, but many people eat other rodents like rabbits and squirrels.  Cultural culinarytaboos have nothing to do with nutrition and if you can ""unlearn"" them a wide variety of newpotential protein sources is available to you.  If you have trapped a nice juicy rat or if Fido andTabby aren't performing a vital task like protecting your food larder, garden or hen house you mayfind the recipes in this section of interest.

Tie the cavityclosed or pin closed with little wooden skewers, threaded in and out of the soft belly skin.  Coatthe whole animal with clay.  Do several coats so you have a good shell formed.  Put in a hole with
hot coals at the bottom and pile hot coals on top of the clay cat.  Throw a blanket of banana leaves
(or other green vegetation) over the hole.  Let bake for 2 or 3 hours while you are tending to otherthings.  The fur will come off when you strip the clay away.
Baked Dog DiRocco

Mike DiRocco, who served three tours in Vietnam, offers a good tip on selecting the best dog forcooking.  He says the Vietnamese judge how tender the dog will be by color; a white dog is best,brown second best and lastly a black dog.  Skin and clean dog.  Remove the glands from under thelegs (they have a strong taste, though they are not harmful if eaten).  Cut into sections.  Put piecesin a pot.  Add bay leaves or aromatics, then onion, red pepper and salt.  Cover with cold water.
Cover pot and boil gently for 30 minutes.  Drain meat and discard water and seasonings.  Cover

Create a Disaster Plan
Meet with your family and discuss why you need to prepare for disaster.  Explain thedangers of fire, severe weather and earthquakes to children.  Plan to share responsibili-ties and work together as a team.
❏Discuss the types of disasters that are
most likely to happen.  Explain whatto do in each case.
❏Pick two places to meet:
1. Right outside your home in case of
a sudden emergency, like a fire.
2. Outside your neighborhood in
case you can’t return home.Everyone must know the address andphone number.❏Ask an out-of-state friend to be your
“family contact.”  After a disaster, it’soften easier to call long distance.Other family members shouldcall this person and tell them wherethey are.  Everyone must know yourcontact’s phone number.
❏Discuss what to do in an evacuation.
Plan how to take care of your pets.Find Out What Could Happen to You
Contact your local emergency management or civil defense office and American RedCross chapter — be prepared to take notes:
❏Ask what types of disasters are most
likely to happen.  Request infor-mation on how to prepare for each.
❏Learn about your community’s
warning signals:  what they soundlike and what you should do whenyou hear them.
❏Ask about animal care after disaster.
Animals may not be allowed insideemergency shelters due to health
regulations.
❏Find out how to help elderly or
disabled persons, if needed.
❏Next, find out about the disaster
plans at your workpl ace, your
children’s school or daycare centerand other places where your family
spends time.41

HOME HAZARD HUNT
During a disaster, ordinary objects
in your home can cause injury ordamage.  Anything that can move,fall, break or cause a fire is a homehazard.  For example, a hot waterheater or a bookshelf can fall.Inspect your home at least once ayear and fix potential hazards.
Contact your local fire department
to learn about home fire hazards.

Working with neighbors can save lives and property.  Meet with your
neighbors to plan how the nei ghborhood could work together after a disas-
ter until help arrives.  If you’re a member of a neighborhood organization,such as a home association or crime watch group, introduce disaster pre-paredness as a new activity.  Know your neighbors’ special skills (e.g.,medical, technical) and consider how you could help neighbors who havespecial needs, such as disabled and elderly persons.  Make plans for childcare in case parents can’t get home.NEIGHBORS HELPING NEIGHBORS❏Quiz your kids every six months so

"Unexpected events—such as earthquakes, fl  oods, and terrorist attacks—can cause widespread problems. 
Although these situations are rare, you can plan for labor and birth at home if a disaster prevents you from getting to a hospital or birth center. Birth has occurred in homes for centuries and can be very safe if you are prepared.
Call for Help
Keep an up-to-date contact list of anyone who may be able to come to help you with the birth. Keep the fam-ily car fi  lled with gas if you are getting close to your due date. If you do go into labor during a disaster, fi  rst try 
to reach your midwife, doctor, or hospital. If you can’t reach your health care provider, call 911. If you have telephone service, a health care provider or 911 operator can ‘talk you through’ labor and birth.
Prepare the Room
Cover the bed with a shower curtain and then place a clean sheet over the shower curtain so you keep the mattress from getting wet. Have your front door unlocked so that rescue workers can get into your home. Get your kit of supplies out and have it open by your bed. Th  e other side of this handout lists the steps your 
helper will take if you do not have a health care provider available when you give birth.
Supplies You Will Need
Giving Birth “In Place” A Guide to Emergency Preparedness for Childbirth  has instructions for managing birth 
and for how to handle emergencies. It is a good idea to get this handout and keep it with your supplies. Y ou

Stay calm and keep the area as clean as possible. Help keep the mom comfortable. Place some towels under 
her to catch fl  uid when the bag of waters breaks and for vaginal bleeding that can occur during labor. Th  e fi rst 
stage of labor can last from a few hours to several hours. Once the mother starts grunting or pushing, the fi  rst 
stage is over, and the baby will be born soon. Th  e pushing stage can last for just a few minutes but may last an 
hour or 2 if this is the mother’s fi  rst baby.
Instructions for Your Helper During the Birth
When you start to see the head at the opening to the vagina, put on sterile gloves. If you don’t have gloves, 
wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water or use hand sanitizer.1.  As soon as the head is out, feel around the head to see if the cord is around the baby’s neck. Th  e cord is 
slippery, round, and feels jelly-like.
2.  If the cord is around the neck, gently lift   it over the head or push it back behind the shoulders.
3.  If the shoulders do not come out immediately: Gently push the side of the baby’s head toward the mother’s 
back to help the shoulders come out and ask her to push. Once the shoulders are out, the rest of the body will come quickly.
4.  If the shoulders still do not come out: Have the mom lie on her back and pull her knees up toward her 
chest, then ask her to push. Th  is helps move her pelvis up and over the shoulders if they are stuck.
Instructions for Your Helper with the New Baby
1.  When the baby is born, place the baby on the mother’s bare chest and cover both of them with a blanket. 
Remove the fi  rst wet towel and keep them covered with dry blankets. Place a hat on the baby.
2.  If the baby is not crying or breathing easily: Rub the baby’s back up and down fi  rmly. Do not spank or hold 
the baby upside down.
3.  If the baby is still not crying or breathing easily: Turn the baby so he/she is looking up at the ceiling and tilt 
his/her head back to straighten the airway, and keep rubbing the back. Once the baby is breathing easily, he/she will turn pink. Th  e baby’s hands and feet will remain bluish for a few hours.
4.  If the baby is gagging or turning blue: Use the bulb syringe to clear fl  uid from the nose and mouth. If the 
baby is still not breathing, start infant CPR.
5.  Tie the umbilical cord in 2 places close together about 3 inches from the baby with the white shoestrings. 
Use a double knot for each. Cut the umbilical cord between the 2 tied-off   sections with sterile scissors. 
Th ere is no hurry to do this. Th  e baby will do best if you wait until you cannot feel a pulse when you hold 
the umbilical cord between your fi  ngers.
Instructions for Your Helper with the Placenta
1.  Th  e placenta will be ready to come out within a few minutes to about 30 minutes aft  er the birth. Y ou may 
see a gush of blood and the umbilical cord get longer when the placenta is ready to deliver. Place the bowl next to the mother’s vagina and ask her to push out the placenta. It will come out with some bleeding and fl uid. Put the placenta in plastic bags.
2.  As soon as the placenta is out, the mother’s bleeding will be like bleeding from a heavy period. Getting the 
baby to breastfeed is very important, because it will slow down the bleeding aft  er birth.American College of Nurse-Midwives

Introduction
Every day millions of people go to work, take their children to school,
go on vacation, go shopping, or just get out and go for a drive.  Butevery so often our routines change drastically due to accidents orother conditions.  These are the times that make us realize how fragileour lives are, or can be.
Emergencies, disasters, accidents and injuries can occur any time
and without warning.  Being prepared to handle emergencies is anindividual as well as a family responsibility.
Emergency planning procedures should cover your home, work, and
recreation place.  These procedures will help reduce the effects ofdisasters and emergencies and could even save someone's life.  Yoursafety, as well as the safety of your family, friends and co-workers,is of primary importance.
The purpose of this guide is to provide self-help information and
disaster safety guidelines for you to use during times of disasters,emergencies, or catastrophic events.
In a major disaster or catastrophe, local government may be severely
affected and may have to recover before it can provide basic servicesto the public.  This action could take some time. During this periodthe citizens of the community must be able to function withoutgovernment assistance.
If you are handicapped, contact your closest relative or neighbour for
help during an emergency situation.
Please study this guide and share it with family members and
co-workers.  Know the do's and don'ts before a disaster strikes.Then keep this material readily available.
The better you are prepared, the better you are able to respond and
reduce panic or confusion when a disaster strikes.  No matter whatthe crisis:  THINK BEFORE YOU REACT, THEN MOVE QUICKLY TOREDUCE YOUR RISK TO DANGER.CM YCM MY CYCMY K

General Safety Information
Much of today's disaster safety information has been around for many years.
Once you have learned the safety guidelines in this pamphlet, chances areyou will not have to learn a new set for many years to come.  But, frequentreview is important.
Watches and Warnings - Know the Difference
The definitions for WATCH and WARNING are the same whether it is for aman-made or natural disaster.
A WATCH simply means that conditions are favourable for an emergency or
severe weather to occur within the defined area.  The WATCH area could bejust your municipality or it could include surrounding municipalities as well.
A WARNING means that somewhere within the area an emergency or severe
weather is taking place.  STAY ALERT.
You should pay attention to both WATCHES and WARNINGS so you can
warn your family, friends or co-workers that a dangerous situation couldoccur or is occurring.
Safety Information
•  Know where to turn off gas, water and electricity.
•  During and following any disaster large or small, be alert to downed
power lines and the smell of gas. Turn power off at the circuit breakerand gas at the meter.
•  Know the difference between a WATCH and a WARNING.
•  Listen to the radio or television for official information.
•  Follow only instructions given by officials.
•  Exercise your plan, make necessary changes and discuss it with family
members.  Identify a place where your family members will meet duringan emergency.
Safety Equipment
• Get smoke detectors for your home.  Replace the
batteries as necessary.
•  Have a portable radio that can run on both AC
and battery power.
• Have a flashlight and extra batteries. It
would be a good idea for the flashlightand radio to use the same size batteries.
•  Get a First Aid Kit.
•  Get a tone-activated weather radio.

Severe Weather
Tornadoes
Danger signs for tornadoes include
severe thunderstorms in the area withstrong, gusty winds, and a funnel ordark column spinning from the sky tothe ground.  You will often hear aloud, roaring noise similar to thenoise of a train or an airplane.Any time there are severethunderstorms in the area, you should stay alert for tornado WATCHESor WARNINGS to be issued by Environment Canada.
Tornadoes can travel in excess of speeds of 100 kilometres per hour but
average 50 kilometres per hour.  The average width of a tornado is about90 to 120 metres at the ground.  The average length is less than akilometre but has exceeded 65 kilometres.  Tornadoes generally occurbetween the hours of 3:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. and about 85 per cent willcome from a southwest direction.
If you are home
If you have a basement, go there and protect your head and face.  If youdo not have a basement, go the the centre part of your house on thelowest level.  A closet or bathroom is usually a good place to seek shelter.Always protect your head and chest from flying objects.
If you are in a high-rise building
DO NOT use an elevator.  Go to the centre of the building, stairwells, orto a rest room.  Follow the directions of building security or officials.
If you are in a vehicle
STOP!  Get out of the vehicle and move away from the tornado's path ata right angle and lie in a hollow or ditch. Remember to cover your headand chest.
If a tornado strikes

Winter Storms
Winter weather conditions can become severe or hazardous with little or no
warning.  Proper preparation plus a knowledge of weather conditions canreduce potential harmful effects to you and your family.
Severe winter weather can take a number of forms
•  Blizzards - A combination of falling, drifting snow and high winds with
a visibility of less than one km and temperatures below - 10°C.
•  Ice Storms - Freezing rain or drizzle that coats roads, trees and hydro
lines causing dangerous driving conditions and power failures.
•  Heavy Snows - Over 10 cm of snow in 12 hours or 15 cm of snow
in less than 24 hours.
• Cold Wave - A rapid drop in temperature of 25°C or more in less
than 18 hours.
Protective Clothing
•  Wear several layers of loose-fitting, light-weight
clothing.  This will keep you warmer than a singleheavy layer of clothing.  The outer garment shouldbe tightly woven and water resistant.
•  Wear mittens, not gloves, for more warmth
and protection.
•  Wear a hood or hat.  You lose much of your body
heat from the head and face area.
Travel Precautions
The best safety precaution during severe weather conditions is to avoidtravelling.  However, if you must drive, be prepared.
•  Have your vehicle tuned-up for winter driving and keep your vehicle
full of fuel.
•  Plan your trips in advance and drive on well-travelled roads.
•  If you plan to go on a trip, tell family or friends of your route, the time
you leave or the time you expect to be at your destination.
•  Listen to the radio for weather updates.
•  If driving conditions become serious, turn back or stop on the side
of the road.
•  Carry a winter survival kit.
Stranded Travellers
If you get trapped in your vehicle, stay with the vehicle, DO NOT panic andremember the following:
•  Avoid exposure and overexertion.
• Check the exhaust pipe to ensure it is not blocked with snow.
• Keep a window partially opened.
•  Run the engine sparingly for heat.
•  Avoid overuse of headlights as they will wear down the
battery.  Use the interior dome light sparingly at night, as anemergency signal. 5
CM YCM MY CYCMY K
•  Exercise by moving your arms and legs.
•  DO NOT let all occupants sleep at the same time.
•  Keep watch for searchers and other traffic.
Winter Survival Kit
Winter survival kits should include the following:
•  Flashlight and extra batteries.
•  Candles and coffee tin.
•  Matches/lighter.
•  Blankets/warm clothing.
•  Granola bars, candy, sugar cubes.
•  First aid kit.
•  Booster cables.
•  Shovel and tow rope.
•  Flares or other signal aids.
Home Precautions
Severe weather conditions may result in power failures which will affect your
home heating system.  Anticipate possible heating system failures by preparingthese materials in advance.
•  Keep a battery powered radio, flashlight and extra batteries.  The
radio and flashlight should use the same size batteries.
•  Keep a supply of candles and matches on hand.
•  Keep adequate food stocks and medical supplies on hand.
•  Have a CSA-approved alternate heat source.
• If you have a stove or fireplace, have the chimney cleaned at least
once a year.
•  Check your home fuel supplies such as wood, heating oil, kerosene,
etc.  DO NOT store liquid fuels in the house.
Heating System Failure Precautions
If your heating system fails, take these precautions:
•  Stay calm - your house will keep you warm for several hours.
•  Avoid opening doors unnecessarily.
•  During a power failure, turn off all electrical appliances.
•  Begin using your alternate heating unit before the house cools down.
•If freezing is possible, turn off the main water valve, drain the waterlines and put antifreeze in toilet bowl, sink and bath drains.  The hotwater heater should also be turned off and drained.
•  Check operator manuals of major appliances for frost protection
requirements.
•  Listen to the radio for emergency instructions.
If You Have Pets
•  Keep extra food/feed on hand.
•  Provide shelter for animals, especially young and small animals or pets.
•  Keep the water source flowing.  Most animals die from dehydration
because the water source was frozen, not from lack of food.  Forhousehold pets, keep them inside or in a dry place.6CM YCM MY CYCMY K

If victim cannot speak or cough,
but is conscious:
•  From behind, wrap your
arms around victim's waist.
•  Make fist with one hand, grasp with other hand.  Place hands above
navel to avoid lower tip of the breastbone.
•  Give one quick inward and upward thrust.
•  Repeat upward thrusts until airway is clear, or victim becomes
unconscious.  If unconscious, refer to the methods used forresuscitation.
If the victim choking is an infant or small child:
•  Support the head and place head lower than trunk; give four
back blows.
•  Supporting the head, turn the infant face up.  Place two or three
fingers on the breastbone between the nipples.  Give fourchest thrusts.
•  Check mouth for obstruction and remove any visible objects.

"Family Food Storage and Emergency Preparedness   
By Debi D. Koontz  
I have a strong belief in the importance of family preparedness. In my home we live on our food storag e whenever life throws us 
an unexpected difficulty. We do not think of our st orage as only being there in case of some drastic e mergency like an earthquake 
or civic unrest. Using your food storage in your da ily life is the only way to be successful in having  a complete and efficient 
supply on hand for whatever you and your family may  be called upon to bear.   
I would be the first to admit that I am, by no mean s, an expert in this area, but I do have an interes t, which has prompted me to 
research this topic, and I can share ideas and expe riences that I have had. I hope this information wi ll be of some use to someone 
somewhere, and that perhaps it may help families pr epare in time.   
This booklet is in two parts. The first part are so me notes, ideas and hints on all aspects of startin g, organizing and using your food 
storage. It is beyond the scope of this work to be complete in all areas on this topic, but is simply a starting place with basic 
information.   
The second part is a detailed list of most of the i tems that should be considered for your storage. I did not simply list each item, but 
described reasons, uses, advantages or disadvantage s about each item. Many item descriptions include i nformation on how best to 
store them. Please read through the list and the de scriptions and decide which are most important to y ou and your family. If you 
are just beginning, it may be wise to prioritize wh at items you intend to store. The list is divided i nto three sections: Food; Health 
& Grooming; and Household & Emergency supplies. Man y medical and emergency uses are given for various food items, 
however, if it’s food then it will be listed in the  food section, regardless of it’s other uses (medic al, emergency, etc.) Each part of 
the list is listed in alphabetical order. This book let covers everything from mild to extreme circumst ances.  
When you read through the list you may be tempted t o think, Oh, I want so much! I’ll never do it! Well , take heart. Don’t let fear 
or doubt overwhelm you. Any storage is better than no storage and even the best storage had to start w ith a single item. Just begin 
and then build it as you can. You can do it!   
Should anyone reading this wish to contact me pleas e feel free to contact me via e-mail at debidawn@earthlink.net  . I would love 
to hear from you. If you wish to pass the informati on in this booklet along, that’s fine, but please k eep it complete and intact, with 
my name attached (for copyright and possible future  publication purposes). I appreciate this. So, now,  read on and enjoy. I 
sincerely hope this is of use to you and your loved  ones.  
   
   
Part One   
Comments on Storage and Preparedness  
*Buy and store what your family eats. You have to b e able to eat and use your food storage everyday to  be able to rotate it. The 
best reason to store what your family eats is that in a time of emergency, if you’ve only stored the b asics like wheat, beans, rice, 
etc. and your family’s diet is suddenly changed, (p erhaps even at the same time you’re all experiencin g stress), you and your 
family’s stomachs and digestive tracts are not goin g to be cooperative and calm. Times of stress are n ot the ideal occasion to 
suddenly change your whole diet. This is especially  true for children.   
*Most foods will last longer than many people think , (especially if they have to) if they are stored w ell. Rotation is the key. Also, 
containers are important. Nearly everything must be  kept dry and airtight. Temperature is important, a nd is often the determining 
factor in the shelf life of many foods. Cool is bet ter that warm. Dry is much better than damp. Insect s must be kept under control. 
Open containers invite pests to come and make thems elves at home.   
*Don’t panic when you think of all you need and wan t to store. It won’t happen overnight. You should p lan your storage as a 
family and set priorities for storing what you feel  is most important first. You can supplement it as time goes by, for as long as you 
are able to. Sometimes it may require sacrifice fro m your family. It’s up to you to decide how much yo u want to invest. There’s no 
wrong way. Any storage is better than none, and eve ry little addition is great.   
*A simple, almost painless way to build your food s torage is to just buy extra products every time you  go to the store. Whenever 
you buy something, buy two. When something’s on sal e, buy the limit. If there is no limit and you can afford it, stock up.   *Your storage should be kept in a dry, clean, cool and hopefully pest-free, and organized place in you r home. If you have not 
organized your storage either on paper or in its se t-up, rotation will be difficult. It’s also hard to  see how much you have and 
decide what you still need. If space is a problem, you may decide to sacrifice a piece or two of furni ture (ex. China cupboard, 
potted plant, spare bed, end table, bedside table, etc.), then put food storage in its place. If it’s impossible to fit all your storage in 
one room in your home, you could break it up (ex.: water storage and camping gear-garage; canned food- kids’ bedroom; first-aid 
supplies-bathroom; boxed items-your bedroom; candle s, batteries, & other emergency supplies-front room ; paper products-
basement). Be sure not to put tempting, easily open ed foods in the children’s rooms. The temptation ma y prove to be too much for 
them. However, they need to be taught now the impor tance and sacred need for the food storage in which  you invest.   
If you really find it difficult to find space for s torage, be creative. Don’t let the lack of space be  your excuse not to prepare. Try 
unusual places like under the bed, inside coffee ta bles or end tables, behind the sofa, in empty space s in drawers and closets, etc. If 
this is the method you are forced to use in your ho me, be very sure you keep a good record of where yo u’re putting everything. 
Wherever you store, just remember that the temperat ure must be cool, and it needs to be as dry as poss ible.  
*Besides your food storage and emergency supplies, you should have a separate 72-hour (3 day & 3 night ) kit. This should contain 
the minimum amount of food, clothes, and water for each family member. 72 hour kits should also includ e any needed medication, 
an emergency shelter (a tarp or cheap lightweight t ent), a first-aid kit, candles, waterproof matches,  pocket knife, flashlight 
w/batteries, and some kind of blanket, bedding or l ightweight sleeping bag. Each kit can be added to a s desired, but should be 
relatively lightweight and easy to carry. Your 72 h our kits should be packed tightly into backpacks, d uffel bags, etc. and should be 
in an easily accessible location (ex: hall closet, near the front door, garage, tool shed, or the trun k of your car). Be sure to rotate out 
all food, water and medicine periodically to keep t hem fresh. This is especially important if your 72 hour kits are stored in an 
outside storage location (trunk, shed, garage, etc. ). Complete kits are available for purchase, but it ’s less expensive to put together 
your own, with exactly the items you desire to met the needs of your family.   
*Remember: Store what you eat, and eat what you sto re!   
(If you think preparedness is not important, imagin e what would have happened to Noah and his family i f they had put off building 
the ark, gathering the animals, and laying in their  food and supplies!)   
   
   
Part Two   
Storage List: FOOD  
Alum (white, powdered )- An imperative food item, with medical uses, to s tore. When sprinkled on an open wound it will draw 
out infection and any drainage. It will leave the s ore disinfected and dry, and will speed healing. (B uy alum in the spice department 
at your grocery store.)   
Applesauce - Whether canned, bottled, homemade, or store-bough t, cinnamon flavored or unsweetened, applesauce is very 
convenient and nutritious. It has a long storage li fe if sealed airtight, and can be used in cooking ( pancakes, bread, muffins, cake, 
cookies, and even casseroles). Since it has natural  sweetness it can even supplement or replace sugar inmost recipes. The old adage 
""an apple a day keeps the doctor away"" aptly applie s to applesauce (and apple juice).   
Baking Powder - If you’ll be doing baking, you’ll want to have so me on hand.   
Baking Soda - There are so many uses for baking soda that a boo  could be written on it’s uses. It can be used as a  deodorant, 
mouthwash, toothpaste, cleaning and scouring agent,  degreaser, and a natural deodorizer. It has leaven ing properties and can be 
mixed with cream of tarter to make baking powder. 1 /2 tsp. mixed in a 4-oz. glass of water is good for  upset stomachs (remember 
bicarbonate of soda?). In laundry it’s good as clea ner and water softener. It also makes soaps stretch  farther. It can be used as a 
coolant for the skin, especially for sunburn, rash,  bee-sting, poison ivy and oak. Helps maintain pH i n water. Baking soda can be 
used safely without polluting the ground water. It also makes a great fire extinguisher.   
Basil- Excellent seasoning for all foods and dishes. Sto res well in airtight containers. Basil tea taken ho t stops vomiting and eases 
stomach cramps. Helpful when applied to snake bites  and insect stings. (The tea is made 2 tsp. per hot  cup water once a day.)   
Beans & Lentils - Excellent and important storage item. Even when s tored so long that they get quite hard, simply soak  them for a 
little longer before using. Put ginger in the water  while soaking beans to lessen problems with gas. B eans are a great source of protein. Cooks well over a campfire if soaked befor e cooking. When sprouted, their nutritional value i ncreases greatly and offers 
inexpensive, year-round fresh greens too add to you r diet.  
Beef Jerky - or other cured smoked meat needs no refrigeration  and tastes as good as it is convenient, while offe ring important 
protein.   
Black Pepper - Convenient, versatile seasoning. Stretches a long  way.  
Bottled Salad Dressing - Your favorite flavor will be a good way to eat sp routs (if you’ve discovered the benefits and ease o f 
sprouting your grains, beans, legumes and lentils).  When sprouts and dressing are joined by canned or fresh vegetables, you have a 
fiber-rich, nutritious salad.   
Bullion Cubes - Great for broth to feed an invalid or sick person . Good to use as a base for any soup. Simply add an y vegetable, 
grain, meat, pasta, etc. Can be used to make gravy,  or r in the water while boiling rice. Stores well in airtight container.   
Candy - A special treat now will become an even more spec ial treat in time of emergency when luxuries are sc arce. Wouldn’t it be 
nice to have candy to give a child on their birthda y if they had no other gift? Candy also offers a qu ick burst of energy because of 
the high sugar content. Candy could well be one of the more popular items for barter (as would soda po p). Luxury items usually 
are. Most candy will store for a fairly long time ( though it may lose color, flavor or texture slightl y), if kept absolutely airtight, 
cool and especially DRY. Individually wrapped candy  is better than soft. If you decide too store candy  be very cautious about 
leaving any open for any length of time. It’s an in vitation to ants and other insects.   
Canned Foods - Stores for a very long time. Try to keep dry and undented. Bulging cans must be thrown away. Rotatio n is very 
important. Many canned foods are complete meals and  don’t require other foods to complete. Be sure to have at least one manual 
can opener. A good variety of canned foods are a sm art foundation to your food storage. Examples of ca nned foods you may want 
to consider storing are:   
Soup   
Stew   
Fruit   
Vegetables   
Juice   
Pasta (ravioli, spaghetti, etc.)   
Spam   
Evaporated milk   
Sweetened condensed milk   
Chili   
Pork and beans   
Meat (turkey, chicken, etc.)   
Tuna  
Cinnamon - Yummy added to oatmeal, bread, wheat, cereal, coo kies, hot chocolate, etc.   
Cold Cereal - In it’s sealed package, in a dry place, most cold  cereals will store 1 to 2 years. Besides being eat en with milk for 
breakfast, some kinds of cereal make handy, nutriti ous snacks straight from the box. It’s very importa nt to use and rotate your 
storage of cold cereals. This will provide you with  maximum freshness for the longest period of time.   Condiments - These are important to store for your own use as well as use for possible barter. These are the ofte n-overlooked 
items, which will make a big difference when you ar e dependent on your food storage. Important example s:   
Mustard   
Relish   
Mayonnaise (rotate!)   
Horseradish   
Steak sauce   
Ketchup   
Barbecue sauce   
Soy sauce   
Tabasco/hot sauce   
Salsa  
Corn Meal - Healthy, tasty, and versatile. Can be used for fr y batter, bread, pone, muffins, cornbread, and panc akes.   
Corn Starch - Cornstarch can be used in place of talcum or baby  powder. Great for diaper rash and other rashes. Ab sorbs moisture. 
Great for cooking. Used as a thickener with simple broth to make gravy. Also will stretch soup and thi cken it. It has carbohydrates 
to provide energy.   
Dehydrated and/or Freeze-Dried Foods - These are the foods with the moisture removed. Th is allows for extremely long storage. 
These are convenient and lightweight to carry, and are easy to prepare. Water rehydrates them. Flavor is retained, and it takes 
much less space to store per serving than other foo d storage items because the process shrinks the foo d to 1/8 to 1/7  their normal 
size. They don’t need to packed in space consuming water like canned foods. (Often, though, the ""water "" from canned foods can 
be used.) You can dehydrate foods yourself in your oven (lowest setting, door ajar), or in the sun at temperatures of at least 110 
degrees. The process takes an average of about 18 h ours. Turn the layer of food occasionally during pr ocess.  
Dried or Ramen Soup - Complete, nutritious, lightweight, and easy to pr epare. Requires only hot water. Stores for a very l ong 
time because there is no moisture in it. (which is what limits the shelf life of some foods).   
Flavorings - Vanilla, almond, and maple are the most common an d useful, though others (orange, lemon, etc.) can b e included to 
suit your families preferences. These could one day  be handy when creativity with your food supply has  you trying to make new 
and different foods.   
Flour - Many uses!! Thin flour water (plus dash salt) bat ter will make tortillas. (Fry on both sides dry or in oil.) Flour can also be 
used as a thickener. Be sure to ROTATE. It can be s tored in the freezer for longer storage but needs t o be kept dry. Flour can help 
blood clot on small wounds. (Put a handful over wou nd and hold firmly with hand until blood flow stops . If you add salt or alum 
into the flour, it will help disinfect.)   
Gatorade/Sports Drink - These drinks can restore vital minerals and nutri ents and prevent dehydration (which can be fatal). Their 
shelf life is fairly long unopened.   
Ginger - Powdered or gingerroot. Made into a tea it can be  used as a decongestant (like hot mustard plaster, but better because it 
won’t burn the skin). Just immerse a towel, rag or old shirt in a strong, heated ginger tea and place on chest to loosen chest 
congestion. It causes heat even after it’s cooled, though it can be re-rinsed in the warm tea. A milde r tea can be drunk for upset 
stomach and gas. Ginger in the water of beans as th ey soak will control gas problems. Ginger is a good  spice to add to any cooked 
vegetable. It’s often used in Chinese cooking.   Hard Red Winter Wheat - Of all grains this stores the longest. It can be sprouted to provide you with fresh greens, even wit h 
limited water. It can be ground, coarse or fine, to  make flour. It can be added whole to soups (or gro und, as a thickener). It can also 
be cooked and served as hot cereal. Wheat is rich i n iron and vitamin E. When storing grains like whea t you should also get some 
kind of grinder or handmill.   
Honey - Every food storage must have honey. It will last forever. Honey, which was found in the tombs of the  Egyptian pharaohs, 
still had it’s beneficial properties. Honey can be used in place of sugar as a sweetener. It’s sweeter  than sugar is so use it at a rate 
of ½ the amount you would sugar. When honey crystal lizes simply melt it in hot water (rotate/turn/shak e during process). Honey, 
used on open cuts, will provide a protective coveri ng and will disinfect (though it’s sticky). Honey a lso helps coat sore throats.   
Hot Cereal - Though you can use your stores of oats and wheat to make hot cereal, there’s advantages in storing p re-packaged, 
commercial brands. They store well and are very con venient. It’s especially nice to store a favorite o f your family. (ex.: Malt-O-
Meal, Cream of Wheat, Maypo, etc.)   
Instant Hot Chocolate - A nice treat, quick energy and very convenient at  home or when camping. It can also be a source of 
warmth on cold mornings. Baking cocoa powder can be  stored too, but it requires more ingredients to us e it to make hot chocolate 
(but it certainly does have many uses in baking tha t make it a good item for your storage).   
Instant Mashed Potatoes - A convenient source of the nutrients in potatoes.  It will store a very long time. The better the 
packaging, the longer its shelf life will be. Canne d is better than boxed. Mashed potatoes leave stoma chs feeling full faster than 
most foods, which is an advantage when trying to st retch your food storage.   
Jell-O- This product offers a way to cover the taste of c hemically treated water. It can be added to with ca nned, fresh or 
dehydrated fruit. Jell can also help relieve diarrh ea symptoms. To do this prepare jell as directed wi th just slightly more water than 
normal. Then drink the jell water while still warm,  like tea. This will also provide necessary liquid to avoid dehydration, which is a 
big danger of diarrhea.   
Jelly & Jam - Stores well. Easy topping for pancakes, tortillas , crackers, and all bread items. Adds flavor and sw eetness to bland 
foods. Can be added in small amounts to cake or coo kie recipes for extra zing, or for a sweet, fruity flavor if used in place of sugar.   
Juice - (canned/bottled/boxed/frozen/powdered) An essenti al storage item. Quick, convenient and very nutriti ous. Adding a variety 
of flavors is good addition to your food storage. J uice can be used as a snack or small meal in and of  itself. It can be used in cooing 
in place of other liquids in many recipes. Apple ju ice can be poured over cold cereal or granola in pl ace of milk. Tomato juice can 
be used in cooking meat or pasta. Tomato juice or v egetable juice makes an excellent base for soups an d stews.  
Kool-aid - This is another item that will help the water tas te better when it’s been chemically treated. It’s a lso a nice addition to 
pancake batter or muffins to add a sweet fruity fla vor. It contains vitamin C, which is an important o ne because the body is unable 
to store it and therefore it must always be repleni shed. If you store the unsweetened kind (which is m uch cheaper and compact), be 
sure you have sugar stored (or sweeten it with hone y). You may prefer to store the kind that already h as the sugar added because it 
is so convenient. There are alternate versions of K ool-aid that contain less sugar, and are already sw eetened (ex. Crystal Light). 
For all of these, however, you absolutely must keep  them dry. It is important that they remain airtigh t as well, so it may be a good 
idea to keep them dry, airtight, and organized for easy access and the ability to rotate, by putting t hem into a plastic container 
(Tupperware, Rubbermaid, etc.).   
Marshmallows - These can be eaten even if they get dried out (wh ich just makes them crunchy). Toasted marshmallows are the 
highlight of camping. They can be used when cooking  yams and pumpkin. They’re also good right out of t he bag for energy. Kids 
love them. Used in making ""cereal treats"" (ex. Rice  Krispie treats- though most cereals will work). Th ey should be fresh (not dried 
out) though to be used this way. A handful added to  Jell, during preparation, is also a nice treat.   
M.R.E.’s - (Meals Ready To Eat) Good for 72 hour kits. Compa ct, complete, healthy, lightweight, and convenient.  Needs no 
refrigeration, and can even be eaten unheated if ne cessary. But they are expensive!   
Nutmeg - Should be used SPARINGLY only. Good sprinkled on hot chocolate and eggnog. Can settle stomachs, naus ea, and 
vomiting. Also can be used as an expectorant. Helps  improve appetite and digestion. Good for helping m aintain a healthy intestinal 
tract. In boiling water it can be used as a deodori zer. A good seasoning to add to bland dishes. But r emember to use it sparingly, 
don’t over do it.   
Oats - Excellent source of bran and fiber. Popular cooki e ingredient. Can be added to meat loaf. Makes nutr itious and filling hot 
cereal. (Added nutmeg, cinnamon, raisins, or dehydr ated fruit makes it even tastier.) Can be used to m ake pancakes. Oatmeal 
baths, masks, and soap are healthy for skin and goo d for itches and rashes.   Oil/Crisco Shortening - Very useful and important, especially when cookin g over a campfire or using food storage basics. But ter 
flavor Crisco can be used in recipes in place of ma rgarine is you have none stored (though powdered bu tter/margarine is 
available). Use slightly less Crisco than the recip es call for. Ideas of recipes that this replacement  can occur are things like 
macaroni and cheese, many casseroles, and definitel y cookies. Oil is used in making bread, tortillas a nd crackers. Can be used to 
make a dressing over sprouts and fresh vegetables. Be sure to rotate. You must do this with these item s particularly. It’s necessary 
to have oil on hand to season cast iron skillets.   
Packaged Dinners - Examples: Tuna or Hamburger Helper, Noodle Roni, and boxed Macaroni and Cheese. These have both 
advantages and disadvantages. The negative points a re that they usually take up a lot of space per ser ving over other storage foods. 
Also, you usually need other foods to prepare them such as milk, margarine or even meat. But if you’ve  got butter powder or 
butter-flavored Crisco and canned or powdered milk,  these can be very convenient. (Meat can be omitted  or substituted). They are 
good because flavors (cheese, etc.) and spices are already added. Everything’s pre-cut and pre-measure d (though additional pasta, 
rice, etc. will stretch the number of servings with out drastically affecting taste or consistency). Yo u can also add any canned or 
dehydrated meat to make it a complete, balanced one -dish meal.  
Pancake Mix - Yummy, quick to make (the best kind to store is t he ones that require only water to be added). Be su re to have a 
good skillet to cook the on. Store completely dry a nd airtight in cool place. ( Muffin Mixes  are similar and also a good storage 
item, but once again, be sure to store ones that ne ed only water to be added unless you have the other  needed ingredients stored as 
well.)   
Parsley - Fresh or dried. Parsley is rich in vitamin C and in iron, calcium, potassium and vitamin A. Prevents  urinary infections. 
Good for fevers. Excellent for prevention of, or ma intenance of, cancer. Cures sting from insect bites  when used in a poultice. A 
tea made from the seeds can be used as a shampoo to  kill vermin in the hair. Helps aid digestion (whic h is the original thought 
behind sprigs of parsley being placed on dinner pla tes in restaurants). Excellent addition to soups, s alads, coleslaw, potato salad, 
casseroles, on meat, or cooked into scrambled eggs.   
Pasta - Some regions have an easier time than others stor ing pasta do. All pasta, however, will be usable st ored for long periods of 
time IF kept cool (to avoid insects like weevils), dry and completely AIRTIGHT. Simply add any number of food storage items to 
cooked pasta. For instance, things like powdered ch eese; cut-up meat product; spaghetti sauce; vegetab les; soup; canned milk; 
powdered butter, etc. Cooked pasta can be eaten col d or hot. Often, leftover pasta dishes can be fried  in a skillet (even over a 
campfire), either plain, or with added scrambled eg gs.  
Peanut Butter - Excellent source of protein and quick energy. Sto res for a very long time unopened. Can be eaten pla in or on 
bread, soda crackers, or tortillas. Travels well an d is convenient because it doesn’t need to be cooke d or refrigerated. One teaspoon 
per day gives needed protein.   
Pop Tarts - These handy food items are surprisingly nutritiou s and extremely convenient. They can be eaten cold,  like a food bar. 
Or they can be heated in toaster or oven. While cam ping, they can be heated on a grill or even on a he ated rock near a fire.   
Powdered Butter - A good item to have on hand with innumerable uses .  
Powdered Cheese - Great to add to pasta or eggs. Makes a good base for a vegetable & cheese soup. Makes easy casserole s. Easily 
stored dairy item.   
Powdered Eggs - Stores for an extremely long time if kept in an a ir-tight container. Add to recipes in place of eggs . Makes 
scrambled eggs and omelets. Added to leftover pasta  (especially mac & cheese) with a little water and/ or oil, and fried, makes a 
yummy meal.   
Powdered Milk - Must have water to mix with it. Store in an air-t ight container in a cool/dry place. Must be used an d rotated 
regularly. Serve it to your family now (plain or mi xed with regular milk) to get them accustomed to it . It is a critical item of your 
storage because it’s needed to use with so many oth er foods and dishes. Doctors have said tat most peo ple could live healthfully 
for a month or two on powdered milk alone!   
Pudding - (boxed mix) With adequate cooling or refrigeratio n, pudding is a nice treat and a good use of your p owdered milk. If 
refrigeration is a problem, then pudding can be use d to make a special treat: ""Quick Shakes"". This is simply unset pudding, but 
could be viewed as an energy drink because of the c alories and carbohydrates it offers. During stress your family will be happy to 
get such a yummy surprise. It does also offer prote in and vitamins. Evaporated milk may also be used ( water should be used to 
dilute the evaporated milk first, however, because it is so rich). Pudding can also be used in baking delicious cakes, cookies or 
pancakes, by simply using it to replace an equal am ount of flour in the recipe. This adds a rich textu re and flavor.   Rice - Must be stored in a cool and air-tight container.  It’s filling and healthy. Water used to cook rice can be saved to drink or use 
in cooking (it’s high in vitamin B). Rice can be co oked in clear broth to add flavor. It can also be a dded to soups. To make rice 
pudding simply add sugar, milk, butter and vanilla.  (More things can be added to your taste). Rice can  be cooked many ways: 
steamed fried or boiled. It can be made into a hot cereal. Added vegetables and/or meat make a complet e meal. Any spice will add 
variety (ex.: spanish rice, curried rice, etc.)   
Salt - In ancient times salt was highly valued. Nowadays  this inexpensive item is an excellent addition to your food storage for 
your own use and for future barter needs. Salt is v ery versatile. It can be used to cure meat, add fla vor to otherwise bland foods, 
and can be used to help ease the pain of sores. It will speed healing (try it on a canker sore). Apply  the salt straight on the wound 
(it sometimes stings initially), or dilute it with water. ½ tsp. in warm water is good for headaches a nd indigestion.   
Sage - Good seasoning for roasts, soups, etc. Can be use d as a cure-all. A strong sage tea is an excellent gargle for tonsillitis or 
ulcers in the throat or mouth (good mixed with lemo n and honey). The sage tea can be drunk cold or hot . It’s one of the best 
remedies for gas, liver, stomach, kidney or bowel t rouble. Will stop bleeding and is good used to clea n old wounds and ulcers. And 
wound will heal more quickly when washed with a sag e tea. It’s useful for typhoid and scarlet fever, m easles and smallpox. 
Soothes nerves and relieves headaches. An effective  hair tonic (will make hair grow if roots haven’t b een destroyed), and will 
remove dandruff. When used in high quantities sage is good for easing female problems, and all lung pr oblems (colds, asthma, 
coughs, bronchitis, influenza and pneumonia). Tea f rom sage should be steeped (while covered), not boi led.  
Soda Crackers - These have a longer shelf life than you might thi nk. The key is to keep them absolutely dry, and of course, air-
tight. If they so get soft and stale, it takes only  a few minutes to ""re-crisp"" them in the oven. Soda  crackers are a bread item in your 
diet and can even be eaten like sandwiches, topped with tuna salad, meat & cheese, or peanut butter an d jelly (it’s good, try it!). 
Soda crackers can also help alleviate queasiness. T hey provide the body with salt, and are a good addi tion to a meal of coup, stew 
or chili.   
Spaghetti Sauce - This makes a quick, easy meal out of any pasta it em. Vegetables, powdered cheese, meat, or spices ca n be added 
to it to taste.   
Spices - If there are spices that you frequently use, it i s a good idea to add them to your food storage so t hat you are able to 
continue to ""spice up"" your cooking.   
Split Peas - These last a long time because they’ve had the mo isture removed. Makes good soup. (add enough spices  and seasoning 
to suit the taste preferences of your family. Meat and onion and carrots are also good additions.)   
Sugar - It’s important to keep sugar cool and very dry, b ut it’s an important part of any food storage. Also  be careful to watch out 
for ants or insects. If the sugar gets hard it can be chipped or grated and then used with no problem as long as it’s unpolluted with 
anything. Sugar may be highly prized one day, but r emember that honey can also be used as a sweetener at a ratio of half that of 
sugar. Brown sugar and powdered sugar may be stored  as well for their many different uses. Brown sugar  is delicious when added 
to beans, wheat cereal, cookies, and is often used in bread, canning and preserving recipes.   
Syrup - Though syrup can be made with water, sugar and ma ple flavoring, it’s very convenient to have some pr e-made syrup on 
hand. It’s better to buy it in small containers so you can use it up in just one or two meals so you d on’t have an opened bottle 
inviting pests (especially if there’s no refrigerat ion). Yummy when added to pork and beans.   
Velveeta - This product doesn’t need to be refrigerated when  it’s unopened and stores fairly long. It’s good ad ded to many dishes, 
melted over bread, tortillas or crackers, or eaten plain. It’s a great source of vitamins from the dai ry food group.   
Vinegar - When mixed with honey it’s a cur-all. It can be u sed as an astringent. It’s a wonderful glass cleane r. It’s used in cooing 
as a preservative (to pickle-when used with salt an d water).  
Whole Cloves - These are used in cooking meat (like ham), and pi ckling and preserving. It adds flavoring to fruits,  soups and 
stews. One or two cloves added to lemonade ""spices""  it up. (Most people do not like to eat the cloves,  only use it as a 
spice/seasoning agent.) Whole cloves can be used di rectly on toothaches to help relieve pain. One clov e can freshen breath after 
only a few minutes in the mouth. A few can be added  to the water of vegetables while they are cooking.  Several cloves in a pan of 
hot water is an effective air freshener (added citr us peel and a cinnamon stick makes it even more aro matic-especially during the 
holiday season).   
(*If you have access to freezer space, it offers yo u a wonderful opportunity to store meat, cheese, ma rgarine, and many other great 
food items. Remember to rotate things as you use/bu y them. I, myself, have a large freezer full of foo d, which I use and have 
stored. However, it’s extremely important that your  ENTIRE food storage is NOT frozen, to prevent the loss of your complete supply if power is lost).   
   
   
Storage List: Health & Grooming  
Antibiotic Ointment - (ex. Neosporin) Speeds healing. Reduces the risk of injuries becoming more severe from infection. Sh ould 
be included in first aid kits, 72 hour kits, and a good supply should be included in your storage.   
Aspirin/Tylenol/Aleve - An absolute MUST! One day it could be your entire  pain-killing ""pharmacy"" in a bottle. This may make  
the difference of pain being bearable or not, for y ou or a family member. Check expiration dates and r otate as you use it.   
Baby Powder/Body Powder - Powder, in olden days, was found in great quantit ies in all the best boudoirs all over the world. Th is 
was because they knew it’s advantages in absorbing moisture, controlling odor, and leaving one feeling  fresh and dry. That way of 
thinking may one day be well emulated if the water and opportunity to wash is restricted. But remember  that the need to wash is 
still very important to hygiene and sanitation. So,  even if it’s greatly reduced due to water shortage , it should never be replaced 
completely.   
Band-Aids/Bandages/Sterile Gauze Pads - A must to have on hand. They will probably be use d quickly so store a lot.   
Bar Soap - You can never store too much. The milder the bett er. Heavily perfumed or deodorant soap may leave a residue or cause 
a rash if inadequate water for rinsing is available . Though you should also store some anti-bacterial and/or surgical soap.   
Calamine Lotion - A good item too have on hand when living at the m ercy of mosquitoes, poison ivy, and other skin irri tations. 
You’ll be happy you have this someday, either for y ourself or for a family member.   
Deodorant - Imagine working hard for your family’s survival, sweating profusely, then being unable to shower or wash very often! 
Or even being able to change into a limitless suppl y of clothes. You, and those around you, might appr eciate having a supply of 
deodorant.   
Diarrhea Control Medicine - (such as Imodium AD) In difficult or stressful ci rcumstances, diarrhea can be a serious problem. 
Especially when there might be tainted food or wate r supplies. Diarrhea, left unchecked, can cause deh ydration, even death. This, 
and all types of medicine, needs to be rotated acco rding to expiration dates.   
Hydrogen Peroxide - (and rubbing Alcohol) An excellent source of disi nfecting. This item could mean the ability to avoid  a severe 
infection. Besides being used directly on wounds it  can also be used to disinfect surfaces (bathroom s inks and counters, and 
needles to take out slivers).   
Lotion - When working hard, this will be a luxury item.   
Misc. First-Aid & Medical Supplies - Take your pick from these following examples of i mportant medical supplies:   
Ace bandages   
Antacid   
Anti-histamine/decongestant   
Bandage tape   
Black silk thread (for stitches)   
Clean scissors (or clean razor blades)   
Cotton balls   
Cough syrup or drops   Disposable gloves   
Epsom salt   
First-Aid book   
Hot water bottle   
Ice packs   
Laxatives   
Medication to induce vomiting   
Q-tips   
Sheets (for bandages and slings)   
Smelling salts   
Splints   
Sterile needles   
Thermometer   
Toothache/canker sore medicine   
Tweezers   
Vaseline  
Prescription & Other Medications - These should be stored as far in advance as possi ble for all family members with special 
needs (ex.: heart problems, asthma, epilepsy, diabe tes, menstrual problems, etc.). Check expiration da tes periodically and rotate as 
you use it.   
Razors/Shaving Cream - If you don’t plan to be excessively hairy, you’ll  need to have a supply of shaving supplies. Don’t f orget, 
an electric razor won’t be good for very much witho ut electricity.   
Sanitary Napkins/Tampons - These might be overlooked, but be careful not to.  Don’t forget growing daughters too.   
Shampoo & Conditioner - Plan a ""head"".   
Toothpaste - You’ll be glad you have it. Even of you don’t hav e a toothbrush and have to use your finger. Remembe r, it may one 
day be very hard to find a dentist. Storing spare Toothbrushes , as well as Dental floss , is a good idea also.   
   
   
Storage List: Household & Emergency Supplies  
Air Mattress/Cot/Ground Pad - If you’re positive that you wouldn’t be able to s leep with a rock in your back on the cold, hard 
ground, then now is the time to prepare. These item s could one day be your bed during an emergency, an d would be a real luxury. 
Patch kits are available to keep air mattresses usa ble. In the meantime, these items are handy for une xpected guests.   
Baby items - If you’re expecting, or prone to get pregnant eas ily items such as formula, cloth diapers, baby clot hes, baby food, and 
bottles could be a blessing to have on hand. If you  do not need these items after all, they would be e xcellent for use as barter to families who find themselves in this unexpected sit uation. For deliveries it’s good to supply items li ke sterile scissors, strong silk 
thread, surgical soap, a nasal aspirator, etc.   
Batteries - If you’re clever enough to store battery operated  radios, lamps, flashlights and so on, you’ll never  have too many 
batteries. Be sure to rotate them now, on an ongoin g basis, as you use them. They can be stored in the  refrigerator. Keep track of 
where batteries are in your home (remote control, c lock, etc.) so you can use them if you run out duri ng an emergency. 
Rechargeable batteries should not be your entire st ore because if there’s no power, then you will soon  be out of luck.   
Blankets - Native Americans used blankets as barter. Pioneer s used blankets as heirlooms and wedding gifts. Hou rs were spent 
hand-stitching quilts. As blankets became tattered and worn they were put to good use as doors, rugs, tablecloths, and were made 
into coats. I don’t think, as you become prepared f or whatever lies ahead, that you could ever have to o many blankets. Especially if 
they are sturdy and warm. Just imagine how apprecia te you would before each and every blanket on a fre ezing night, especially if 
you and your children are sleeping without electric ity or even outside. If you did end up with too man y blankets, there would be a 
demand for them I’m sure.   
Bleach - This is an inexpensive storage item that is quite  valuable. It can help you have a purified water su pply, clean clothes, and 
disinfect almost anything. Don’t buy a more expensi ve name brand. Bleach is bleach. Also, avoid bleach  with a fragrance added.   
Bug Spray/Insect Repellent - These may one day be your only line of defense ag ainst those pests who often carry diseases. 
Mosquito netting may be a good investment as well.   
Camp Shovel/Hatchet/Hammer/Saw/Axe - If you are living in the great outdoors, or in re duced circumstances, you’ll need the 
tools to help you survive. Digging latrines or cook ing pits, chopping wood, setting up tents and cloth eslines may be daily activities 
some time in the future. Even id you’re living in y our home, but are unable to use the toilet because of lack of water, you’ll need to 
dig a substitute one.   
Cast Iron Skillet/Dutch Oven - Skillets work really well over a campfire if they  are seasoned. They retain heat and cook evenly.   
Candles - Quick and easy to use. Portable. Takes no batteri es, kerosene or electricity. Be sure to store candl eholders too! 
Smokeless, dripless tapers are nice, but big, wide candles last longer. Votive candles aren’t as good because they don’t last very 
long.   
Clothes - Sturdy, well-made clothes for all seasons are imp ortant to have for each member of the family. If yo u have growing 
children be prepared with sizes to accommodate thei r growth. Remember that fashion will not matter. Qu ality and fit will mean 
much more. Thick socks and sturdy shoes are excelle nt to have. Extra pairs might want to be considered . Work gloves, winter 
gloves and hats, extra shoelaces, dependable wristw atches, winter coats, warm pajamas, and so on are a ll very good items to have 
on hand. Be sure to have each item for each member of the family.   
Clothesline/Clothes Pins - Back to basics. When clothes get wet, or hand was hed, you’ll need a way to dry them to prevent mold 
for forming. Clotheslines can also make temporary s helters with sheets, blankets, tarps, and tableclot hs draped over them.   
Dish Pans & Dish Drainers - Most of us have been spoiled by automatic dishwas her and don’t’ have these useful things on hand. 
These will become important to having clean, sanita ry dishes and pots and pans if you are without powe r. Also, if water is in short 
supply, the dish-panful of water would have to last . These can be used indoors or out. They don’t cost  a lot, so they are a good 
investment.   
Garden Seeds - Be sure to store non-hybrid seeds to get the maxi mum amount of harvest after the first year. Store s eeds in a dry 
place. Growing your own fresh produce is a wonderfu l addition to a stored diet and allows you to survi ve on a more permanent 
basis. Make sure to store enough extra water to kee p your garden growing through dry times. Never wate r your garden in the heat 
and light of mid-day. Include herbs in your garden.  They add flavor to all meals and often have medici nal qualities.   
Grinder or Hand Mill - This is a necessary item to have to grind wheat o r other grains, into flour or meal, if you have the m in 
your food storage. Though expensive, electric grind ers are easy and fast. Hand mills are good when the re’s no electricity.   
Kerosene - Return to the old days. What worked for your gran dparents will work for you. Kerosene stored for a l ong time. Be sure 
to keep it upright. If you store kerosene, make sur e you have lamps to use with it, and visa-versa.   
Liquid Dish Soap - Versatile product. Besides washing dishes, it can  wash clothes, camping gear, shoes, floors, and han ds.   Lysol- (or other disinfecting spray) This is a great way  to control germs (& odors) which can cause disease . Great caution must be 
taken, however, not to get any on food or food prep aration areas, or where children or pets could get it into their hands (or paws) or 
in their mouths.   
Matches - Long-handled fireplace matches are great. Also an y wood match is good. They should be stored in wate rtight containers. 
Flint, fire-starting stones are very handy with lim itless uses. You should also try to store at least some waterproof matches. These 
are good in 72-hour kits.   
Means of Mobility - Be creative. Bicycles, wheelbarrows, handcarts, w agons, etc. You need to think ahead of what you mig ht use 
to transport yourself and your supplies in an emerg ency situation. You may want to store repair suppli es like extra inner tubes, tire 
patch kit, etc.   
Paper Plates/Cups/Bowls & Plastic Utensils - When water becomes scarce, and sanitation is a pr oblem, these will be extremely 
important to you. The best and least expensive plat es to store are the cheap, plain white ones sold in  packages of 100 or more, 
often for less than a dollar. They take up little s pace and when used with re-usable plate holders the y’re stronger than the bulkier, 
more expensive styrofoam plates.   
Paper Towels - These can be used as disposable towels, tissues, napkins, wash cloths, and toilet paper. Well worth the effort to 
save them.   
Pencils/Pens & Paper - These will become more valuable and appreciated a s access to them stops. You will want to be able wr ite 
journals, recipes, notes, and reminders. If you fin d yourself home-schooling your children, paper and pencils would be invaluable. 
(Books too.)   
Pet Food - If Rover or Fluffy are important members of the f amily don’t forget to store food for them. Be sure to use and rotate, 
especially dry food. Canned pet food stores quite a  long time. Pets can also live on many regular food  items you might have stored 
(especially if they’re hungry). Even beef or chicke n broth. Though they may help the rodent population  by supplementing their 
diet themselves.   
Plastic Wrap/ Foil/ Wax Paper/Trash Bags/Ziplock Ba gs - Important items for food preparation and storage.  Only unscented 
clear or white trash bags should be used to hold un wrapped food. All trash bags make good ground cover , emergency ponchos, 
equipment cover, and makeshift shelters. Foil is gr eat for cooking in, or over, a campfire. Ziplock ba gs are versatile for holding 
food, matches, candles, first-aid supplies, even a dry pair of socks. Wax paper is good for food prepa ration work space.   
Pocket Knife/Hunting Knife - Let your imagination tell you all the reasons why  these are critical emergency storage items.   
Radio - (Short-wave or transistor) Be sure it runs withou t electricity and is portable. A simple antenna is an added investment. This 
could be your link to the outside world in case of emergency.   
Rope/Nylon Cord - This may turn out to be one of your most valuable  supplies. Uses include everything from creating sh elter, to 
emergency rescue, to a creative outdoor shower or l atrine.  
Safety Pins - Whether living in your home, or in the open, safe ty pins have limitless uses from clothing repair to  first aid.   
Scrub Brush/Broom/Bucket/Mop - Cleanliness and sanitation may one day be very im portant to keep you and your family 
healthy, as well as comfortable. Even living in a t ent, a broom will be handy to keep the floor of the  tent clean and dry. A simple 
twig, when stepped on, can cause a rip in the tent fabric. How much easier to sweep it out than to wor ry about repairing your tent.   
Sewing Kit - The size and contents are up to you. For instance , if you have stored fabric you’ll need plenty of t hread. But every 
household will need a sewing kit of some kind to ke ep clothes, blankets and towels in good repair. A s maller version is ideal for 
72-hour kits.   
Tarp - This is another versatile item. The more you have  on hand, the more you’ll find uses for. A few idea s are: a ground cover, a 
shower, a tent, as well as means of protecting your  firewood and supplies.   
Toilet Paper - Do I even need to say how very important you migh t one day find this item to be? It could be quite v aluable, in fact. 
I know that I would much prefer it over leaves and dirty scraps of paper. It will store forever if you  keep it dry.   Towels - When you can’t do a load of laundry every day, an d you and your family are trying to stay clean and dry, and when you 
are trying to keep pots and pans and dishes clean, you will treasure every single towel you posses. Es pecially if you lose or ruin 
any and are unable to replace them. Towels also mak e good throw rugs when living in a tent.   
Travel Game/Deck of Cards - If you had no TV, movies, video games or librarie s at your disposal, how much would you and 
your children appreciate a diversionary activity? P ut a couple in your 72-hour kits. These items could  be invaluable to keep 
children occupied while you are busy.   
Vinyl Tablecloths - These provide more than just a clean eating area.  They can be used as blankets, curtains, ground cov er, and 
emergency shelters. They can also be made into rain coats or ponchos. In an emergency, they can be cut down to be placed around 
feet by tying a cord around the ankles to keep in p lace. Shower curtains can be used in similar ways t o these tablecloths, though 
with less durability, thickness or warmth. Never th row away old shower curtains or vinyl tablecloths. They could still be quite 
useful.   
Water - This is, without question, the single most import ant and life-saving item you could store! Besides b eing necessary to drink, 
it’s needed to wash clothes and dishes and to bathe  in. It will need to be used sparingly because no m atter how much you have, 
you’ll never know how long you will have to depend on your supply. I fear that long before people woul d start to panic over 
finding food, they will be desperate for water. Wat er can be stored in glass or plastic containers (ex cept milk containers because 
they are biodegradable), and must have an airtight lid. A small piece of plastic wrap placed over the mouth of the container before 
you put the lid on helps keep the water fresh. You can use tap water plain if you change it once a yea r, or add a small amount of 
bleach or other commercial purification product bef ore storing indefinitely. You can also boil water b efore using to kill germs and 
improve the taste. Try to store your water in a coo l place. Don’t overlook the water in your toilet ta nk and water heater in an 
unexpected crisis. Waterbed water can be used for w ashing, but don’t drink it or use it on eating surf aces because of contamination 
due to the chemicals used in making the plastic lin ing.  
Water Purification Tablets or Containers/Filter Pum ps - An absolute must. These can be life-saving. They can help turn most 
unusable or questionable water sources into safe dr inking water. These are especially vital when livin g ""on the trail"" or outdoors. 
Boiling water helps remove the bacteria too.   
   
(*One last note from the author: I sincerely hope a nd pray that this information will be of help to so meone. I would hope that after 
reading this you would not feel apprehensive or sca red or negative. We are told that the righteous nee d not fear, and preparation,

he 72 -hour kit or 3-day survival  pack  is based in military preparedness ––soldiers carried 
survival supplies when involved in military operations to allow them to pr otect themselves, 
to provide the necessities to take care of their personal needs, and to complete their a s-
signed mission. F or the average citizen, it’s a ready -to-use pac kage containing food and 
water rations, supplies, and such other vital equipment for maintaining personal well -being —or, at 
least, staying alive when forced into extremely dangerous or uncontrollable circum stances.    
 
The idea of individuals and families having survival kits is based on the firm —and confirmed —
belief that natural disasters and personal emergencies is not a matter of whether they will happen, 
but when. Having a few basic categories of supplies a nd provisions on hand can mitigate that hel p-
less feeling caused by emergencies. Being prepared reduces the panic associated with the occu r-
rence of seemingly uncontrollable events.  
 
In a complete readiness plan, one would have survival kits available for al l possible situations:  
 
 
 at home  
  at work  
 at play  
  in the car / truck  
 traveling by boat / bus / plane / train  
  at school / college  
 when on vacation / hotel / overnight  
  other: _____________________________  
 
 
When designing or purchasing a survival kit, con sider the level of preparedness you wish to 
achieve for yourself or your family. A most important aspect of a survival kit is that it be able to 
keep you alive and well when you are confronted with an emergency or survival situation. Use the 
information in  this chapter to organize your own Emergency Preparedness Action Kit  (E/PAK ), 
as we have nicknamed it ––our version of the 72 -hour kit. Or, you can purchase one that meets your 
needs. The listings at the end of this article identify  some providers of ready -made kits you can buy 
off the shelf.  T

 MY MOTHER ’S WISDOM  
 
I learned about preparedness and survival kits from my mother. She was wisdom personified and 
always seemed to know what to do, no matter what the occasion! I truly regret it took me so long to  
realize it. As a fledgling Boy Scout ––less than a Tenderfoot, actually ––the troop was going on a 
long-awaited and unprecedented early spring camping trip. At last, I was going to be with the older 
boys whom I not only admired, but secretly revered. The last t hing I wanted was to be embarrassed 
by being unprepared ––heaven forbid, imagine not being prepared at 12 years of age!  
 
When I asked Mother what to take on this extended outing, she replied in her soft -spoken manner, 
practically without a moment’s hesitat ion, ―You need to wonder what could happen and be willing 
to pay the wages of wandering in the wilderness. Take some water, Wranglers, weenies, wipes, 
warm clothing, weather protection, a weapon, a wayfinder, and whatever, and keep a watchful 
eye... ‖  
 
I knew t his was going to be ―W‖ formula , no doubt! Let me elaborate on her method of guidance. 
She had taught me everything in the world operated on a formula. The only other ― W‖ formula she 
had told me was, ― Working will win when wishing won’t !‖ 
 
Evaluate these ―W‖ formula preparedness point ers in relationship to your own emergency and di s-
aster preparedness  efforts . 
 
Wonder: determine , by some serious thinking , what  problems might occur in the field (or in my 
life), such as:  
– To which wonders of Nature I’d b e vulnerable,  
– What  some other creature ––man or beast ––might cause me harm, or 
– Which  personal problems I might  suffer . 
 
I think she wanted me to ponder what experience s I might not be able to control. She wanted me to 
plan for the worst, hope for the b est, and be able to deal eventually with whatever happened.  
 
Willing/ Wages: meant that I must be willing to pay the price to make this trip ––time, effort, and 
risk. From the available alternatives, was this most practical, prudent, and provident for me? I had 
to decide if it was the most ― bang for my buck ‖ at that moment —and about the longer -term cons e-
quences and implications . Even at that early age, I had already be come  aware of the consequences 
of being unprepared. Mother was indicating the price I would pay for not being prepared for the 
future eventualities in my life.  
 
Wander : once departed from her presence , the security I had at home would be unavailable, and it 
would be as if I were wandering in the wilderness, all alone.  
 
Water:  ―Take water ,‖ she sa id. ―Y ou can’t live very long without drinking water ––just a few 
hours without it and you’re in deep trouble! Of course, that’s not necessarily true of taking a bath 
in times of emergency. But it is one of those things a young boy can learn to do without, at least 
during a weekend or an emergency. You can live three days without water, but you get weaker 
every hour without it. ‖ 
 
Wranglers:  meant having appropriate clothing for the occasion, depending on the environment. In 
my youth, jeans (we could afford t he name brand Wranglers  only after the harvest was in the barn) 
were the working -class clothes in our ex -urban community —could be worn for man’s work ––and 
camping out, too. They were sturdy clothing, long -wearing, tough, and easily maintained. This 
admonit ion was also meant to include a regular change of underwear. (How embarrassing to be 
wearing dirty underwear in case  you were taken to the hospital after  a camping accident!)  
 
Weenies:  meant the need for nourishment. My mother knew my penchant for hot dog s and pork 
and beans. Her instruction to me was to take food that (1) I would eat even under the stress of b e-
ing away from the well -spread table she always prepared ; (2) is easily prepared in the boonies ; and 
(3) I’d normally enjoy. (I would have preferred  her homemade oyster stew ––but that would have 
been totally impractical for the camping environment ––as it would be for most emergency situ a-
tions!)  
 
We are capable of doing without a lot of things , even  when we’re stressed. H owever, having fami l-
iar food t o eat when everything else is going badly gives us comfort far beyond the cost of the 
food. Food is such an important part of creating and maintaining a positive attitude, especially  
Preparedness  is 
the state of being 
prepared  or in put 
in proper condition 
of readiness before  
an approa ching 
event ––something 
expected, even 
thought possible, 
or unexpected ; to 
put things  or one-
self in readiness .

 when all else is falling apart, that it bears repeating: don’t take anyon e else’s opinion about your 
emergency food supply ––store what you like to eat and you’ll eat what you’ve stored ––and you 
won’t lose it!  
 
Wipes:  intimated that if I ate during this camping trip, eventually the natural necessity for wipes 
would occur. Not to mention a runny nose from the overnight in the wilderness! Wipes were i n-
deed essential then for any trip away from home ––and still are! This was also meant to remind me 
about the need for good personal hygiene and grooming ––a little soap and elbow greas e to remove 
the dirt and smoke odor from my body  and clothing . There is no greater  comfort than being our 
best self ––putting our best foot forward ––handling whatever we encounter with panache and style.  
 
Warmth: how can anyone be prepared if the elements are ignored? Back then, the job of finding 
both small and effective means of keeping warm was more difficult. Today we have modern tec h-
nology ––so many new fabrics for clothing and camping gear, equipment , and supplies to help in 
this life -saving necessity.  Of course, let us not forget the need for fire to prepare  food, purify w a-
ter, and provide warm water for bathing.  
 
Weather protection:  this was the need for adequate shelter from the unpredictable spring weather 
in North Carolina ––a tent and some waterpro of matches. For today’s considerations it includes the 
provision of living space that precludes a family from suffering the effects of inclement weather ––
whether it’s intemperate climate, moisture, or wind -driven forces.  
 
Weapon: a brand -new Swiss knife at tached to my belt for all to see ––talk about proud! Nobody 
was going to mess with me and the complete arsenal at my fingertips. I was prepared for even a 
bear! Besides, it was a miracle -making tool just waiting to be unleashed, whether for opening a can 
of weenies, beans or soup, shaving a stick for fire tender, or carving an ―X‖ on a tree to mark the 
trail (forgive me, tree -huggers ––I was only 12 years old!)  
 
Wayfinder:  meant having the appropriate equipment, such as a wrist compass and a local area 
road m ap. At least, I could find my way back to the camp, home, or anywhere on that map, should 
I be the victim of a ―snipe hunt‖ with the senior scouts. Make sure you have maps of local streets, 
as well as maps of your destination, if you must depart from your home.  
 
Watchful eye:  this part of the communication was a little bit trickier because it was somewhat 
more philosophic, but I know it meant being prepared for any emergency. I practiced until I was 
compass -trained and physically ready to take the fifty -mile hike. I was also required to learn all the 
first aid information, up to and including how to cut the ― X‖ through the skin for subsequent 
snakebite treatment. Thank heaven tha t treatment has been superseded ! Actually, upon reflection, I 
couldn’t have cut the snake, much less cut an ― X‖ on my own body!  
 
Whatever: meant a category was for anything I wanted to take that wasn’t in the proscribed cat e-
gories listed above ––like my genuine silver -plated Duncan  yo-yo!…or the latest Marvel  comic 
book… or jacks and m arbles ––whatever was important then for my comfort and pleasure  under 
trying conditions !  
 
Watchcare: meant caring about the others on the camping trip. This was a quality my mother had 
in bountiful supply ––she really cared about others, constantly on the lookout for someone who 
needed a lift. Her ― good neighbor ‖ policy was in full force at all times. She practiced the true spirit 
of caring about th ose in her  community.  
 
So, my mother’s instructions sent me scurrying enthusiastically throughout all three f loors of the 
house, looking for the equipment I needed to impress the older Scouts in the troop. As the se e-
mingly essential items were located, I placed all the pieces of equipment and little piles on my u p-
per bunk, then called her for approval. At this po int I learned how to choose what is essential, and 
how to focus on economy, efficiency, and personal well -being.  
 
Mother regarded all the gear and paraphernalia I had assembled. I remember her saying quietly , 
“Pep without purpose is piffle!”  She gently (w ell, not so gently that I soon forgot!) instructed me 
to sort all of my stuff into three piles. I was to place in the first pile the items I couldn’t  do without, 
a second pile for ―stuff‖ I thought  I might need, and a third pile for the things I’d like to take with 
me.  
 Notes  
 
Planning will assure 
you’ve considered 
your needs in case of 
an emergency, disa s-
ter, or life -threatening 
situations.  
 
 4 Your Personal & Family E-PAK 
 
 
 
 After I had ordered my piles as instructed, mother looked at the three piles carefully and made a 
couple of corrections to my piles . She then told me to return the stuff heaped in the second and 
third piles to the drawers and closets ––and to place in the camp bag only the items in the first pile. 
You know, even years later, mother’s words were my guidance when I traveled more than a million 
miles as an international business traveler. What I eventually learned is that the quality of any tr ip 
is being able to travel  without a great deal of non -elemental ― stuff.‖ 
 
SURVIVAL OR PREPAREDNESS KITS? 
 
Responsibility for your family begins in your own home. You are ultimately responsible for pr o-
tecting yourself, your family, and your property to the  best of your capability. This entails planning 
and preparing your own resources to mitigate the effects of  by prepar ing for, respond ing to, and 
eventually, recover ing from natural  and people -caused  disasters that often become our personal  
disasters. Being  prepared requires learning about potential disasters and emergencies, knowing 
first aid, CPR, and other life -saving skills.  
 
Adaptability is critical to preparedness and self -reliance. A sense of independence is necessary, 
too. Unfortunately, self -relian ce skills are not taught in the schools ––they are learned at the hand 
of a tough and uncaring taskmaster! How well you respond to these disasters is determined by your 
level of preparation.  
 
There are five basics you should stock in your home: (1) water, (2) food, (3) first aid supplies, i n-
cluding medication(s), (4) clothing and bedding, and (5) tools, emergency supplies, and special 
needs items. Keep the items you will most likely need during an evacuation in an easy -to-carry 
container such as a large, co vered trash container, camping bag, backpack, or duffel bag. Keep a 
mini-version of the disaster supplies kit in the trunk of your car —and one for each vehicle your 
family utilizes.  
 
Utilize all the knowledge you can gain to prepare for the disasters which  could cause you and your 
family more than loss of your car, your property, or your crops. To become truly prepared, you 
must re -forge yourself, break out of the mold, study, learn, practice, and increasingly improve your 
self-reliance skills until you are  comfortable with your new self. There is no easy way to become 
self-reliant —it requires work ! To become self -reliant requires also m eaningful efforts in self -
education and often, some large measure s of self -denial.  
 
IT’S YOUR CHOICE ––MINIMAL …O R MORE? 
 
There are different levels or factors of risk  associated with t he many different types  of disasters . 
There are varying levels of preparation . So this is the best rule for becoming prepared:  
 
Your preparation level should always exceed  the risk leve l!  
 
Go b ack to Chart 1  – Potential Weather -Related Disasters by Listed  to see the  listing of the 
expected  weather -related disasters that could affect your particular geographic location.  
 
There are three (3) types of action s from which you can choose to help you deal with these pote n-
tially disastrous weather -related conditions should you be victimized by them.   
 
You alone make the choice from among these options : 
1. Survival ––requiring minimal investment or effort ; survival mode  places you in the co n-
trol of happensta nce and volunteers ––or not!  
2. Preparedness  (at some level) ––all levels of preparedness require  serious  effort and su b-
stantial investment of  your time, personal  energy , and money; and,  
3. Self-Relian ce––preparing  at the highest level of your family’s capability,  learning, doing , 
and adapting your lifestyle ; sharing  and being a resource  to your community.

 Notes  6 Your Personal & Family E-PAK 
 
 
 
 DESIGNING YOUR EMERGENCY /PREPAREDNESS ACTION KIT 
 
On the following pages are detailed listings to help you personalize your own 72 -hour kit —the 
Emergency/Preparedness Action Kit  (E/PAK .) 
 
Use the charts to determine what you have in inventory alread y for your family E/PAK  and to d e-
fine the need s for each member of the family ––items, quantities, and selections of foods, food s-
tuffs, and equipment. Keep items for a family evacuation in easy -to-carry containers . You decide 
whether a large, covered trash container, camping backpack, footlocker , plastic chest, or duffel bag 
suits your needs best.  
 
If you have the resources, keep an E/PAK  in the trunk of your car. You may want one at your place 
of business, also. It’s cheap insurance for saving your life ––or the life of a family member, a 
friend, or a co-worker! Hopefully, most of us won’t need the E/PAK , but being prepared for the 
eventuality is good to ease  the mind. I hope the worst case for our individual E/PAK  is to have in a 
central location all the thi ngs we’d need for ― hunkering down ‖ when a natural disaster, such as a 
wind, ice, or snowstorm , or a people -caused disaster causes a power outage.  
 
 
―Bug -out‖ or Not?  
 
Personally, I don’t plan to ― bug-out!‖ I don’t have any other place I want to go, unless  it’s to an 
expensive hotel that has complete and luxurious facilities. With my 3 -day kit in hand, I could even 
endure a public shelter ! I just don’t intend to leave my home and all the equipment unless a life -
threatening disaster requires it. Having revie wed the potential natural, people -caused, and personal 
disasters that could possibly happen to me, the alternatives are clear to me as to what I would  do in 
each case.  
 
I’ve spent the weekend in a church recreation hall with several other families, during and in the 
aftermath of an ice storm. It wasn’t too bad ––the worst part was the lack of privacy  and no heat . 
I’ve also spent a few days at my parents’ house ––kids and all ––when the side of town where we 
lived had a power failure ––and we had an all -electric  home!  I certainly don’t intend to head for the 
unfamiliar hills, living in the wilderness fraught with unknown dangers, chasing wild animals with 
switches, fending off others in a similar plight, and trying to maintain an urban lifestyle.  
 
However, the v ery thought of driving  on the freeway or city streets during a disaster situation, 
competing for space with all those folks carrying handguns (even the ones with permits) and other 
weapons is just a little frightening to me. Whereas I can’t defend the enti re city, I could maintain 
my independence in my own home with adequate provisions.  
 
My plans are to enjoy the disaster  and appreciate the intervention in my normally extra -long wor k-
day to spend it with my wife, my dog s, and the peace  and quiet the lack of electricity would bring .  
 
Perhaps it would be a moment to pretend it’s another vacation in the back hills of the Appal a-
chians … 
 
Choose and act accordingly!  Carpe diem  because tempus fugit ! 72-Hr.+ Emergency/Pre paredness Action Kit     7 
  
 Rotation ! 
 
The rules of rotation are not suspended for  your E/PA K! Every 90 to 180 days the E/PAK  should 
be inventoried. Exchange water, food, and clothing for current supplies. Consume the goods to 
assure yourself of your choices. Check to assure the E/PAK  is re-provisioned with your new inve n-
tory, and re -set in its s torage location.  
 
Enjoy this requirement for rotation . Buy some really good gourmet -type foods for your E/PAK  
(you’d certainly eat the gourmet - and picnic -quality foodstuffs you’d find at a high -class business 
party, classy brunch, or invitation -only so cial event) and have an ―emergency picnic‖ with your 
rotated foods. These emergency preparedness ―trial runs‖ will provide occasional practice for the 
time(s) when disasters for which you’ve prepared actually occur. It’ll further prepare you mentally 
for the eventuality of a disaster, and make the event’s foreboding nature a little more bearable.  
 
 
E/PAK  Categories  
 
Supply categories are as follows, with the correlation of E/PAK  categories to my M other’s  list:

EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS ACTION KIT (E/PAK ) CHECKLIST  
 
There are a lot of selections from which to choose. You, too, might elect to sort your ― stuff‖ into 
three piles, as my Mother suggested to me! Details of the E/PAK  categories are listed in the fo l-
lowing chart. Items in boldface  type are  considered essential. There are many blanks for you to 
add the things that are important to you and your family.  
 
There are hundreds of versions of 72 -hour kits. Indeed, they should all be customized to the user. 
The following chart will help you create y our own customized and specialized 72 -hour E/PAK .

WHY ONLY 72-HOUR EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS ? 
 
There is no intent in this document  to discuss all the causes and solutions for emergencies and di s-
asters. Ther e are, however, numerous resources  which can help you prepare for natural or people -
caused disasters, or for any resultant personal disasters  that might occur to you and your family. 
There is a n additional  listing  of resources  on the back page.  
For all the minute details of 72 -hour (or longer) emergency preparedness issues, there are a few  
books I suggest you read and utilize. One of the best overall book s is Barbara Salisbury’s , 
―PLAN ...NOT PANIC, 72-Hour Survival/Emergency Evacuation. ”1 She als o has a newer book , 
Preparedness Principles , with so me additional excellent ideas. Preparedness Principles  is a big, 
comprehensive  volume of work about preparedness.   
Barbara ––whom I’ve known since 1972 and respected some time  before then ––defines an evacu a-
tion as a localized occurrence which forces residents from their homes on a moment’s notice . It 
only takes being forced from your home one time to convince the wise person of the need for an 
emergency kit that is prepared in advance and available for use when needed. In her book, orig i-
nally published in May 1994, she provides step -by-step instructions ––missing from most other 
emergency/disasters publications ––for the preparatio n of a personalized 72 -hour kit. As I read her 
book cover to cover, I’ll remark on some things she points  out that are critical for each of us to 
know:  
 It's a fact of life that sooner or later you may have to be evacuated from your home!  
 Panic takes over if practical preparation has been ignored.  
 Lag-Time
 ––not the disaster ––is the r eason for a 72 -hour kit! This is probably the least 
understood point in this facet of emergency preparedness.  
 Lag-Time is the villain  of most evacuations. It is imperative to understand its impact on 
all facets of preparation for an evacuation.  
 The more severe the disaster, the greater the corresponding impact of Lag-Time .  
 Lag-Time  is why you can't rely on the government or emergency disaster organizations to 
come to your aid immediately.  
 When individuals are prepared to take care of themselves, they ha ve greater security.  
 Properly prepared persons are a tremendous help for those who eventually arrive to assist 
and support in disaster situations.  
According to Barbara, the critical parameters of a well -planned and well thought -out 72 -hour 
evacuation and s urvival plan are:  
 Understanding the two categories of emergency preparedness and how it affects not 
only your preparation, but also your ultimate survival.  
 Using a Neighborhood Evaluation Form to determine if there is a potential evacuation 
lurking in your  future.  
 Creating a 72 -hour kit economically to meet your personal needs.  
 Including more than three “energy bars” and a flashlight in your 72 -hour kit!  
 Knowing why the right kinds of foods are vital in an emergency situation ––and are 
very different from th ose typically kept on the emergency shelf.  
 Having an emergency water supply is essential.  
 Designing your own „'security blanket.‟‟

  Establishing a ""Care -In-A-Crisis"" plan is critical to all of your family members.  
 Knowing what you must do about shelter, hea t, and warmth.  
 Don't ignore the need for personal sanitation!  
 Preparing properly with the exclusive Personal Planning Pages can make the diffe r-
ence between panic and the ability to cope with an emergency situation.  
Often in the aftermath of natural or peo ple-caused disasters, everyone taught that as much as 3 
days (72 hours) lapses between the actual occurrence of the emergency and the arrival or availabi l-
ity of competent help. After the experiences of Hurricane Katrina and other cataclysms such as 
the Indonesian tsunami , we no longer adhere to that expectation. Depending on the gross amount 
of damages, the extent of the disaster’s footprint, and it geographic location, the response time for 
relief care of is extended to as much as 7-10 days be fore aid is  organized  and operating effectively.  
 
There are two other friends who are authors and specialist with solid information and expertise on 
the subject of preparedness. One of them  is Rita Bingham , a preparedness issues author and nat u-
ral meals specialist. Pr eview her preparedness book, The New Passport To Survival ––12 Steps to  
Self-Sufficient  Living . Rita is also a long -time acquaintance, and her specialty lies in her kno w-
ledge of  nutrition and natural foods. Her books are available on her website:  
http://www.naturalmeals.com/passportnew.html . 
 
Another friend and expert is  LeArta Moulton , author,  and food storage specialist. LeArta has 30 
years of extensive research on using whole  foods, herbs, home remedies, and survival techniques.

You alone may be responsible for the provisi on of adequate food, water, shelter, etc., for your very 
survival during th e period of time  it takes for the arrival of the emergency and disaster relief orga n-
izations ! 
 
E/PAK  –– SOME ESSENTIAL GUIDELINES  
To provide you and your family maximum protection i n case of an emergency, your  E/PAK ––
whether for 72 hours or for several weeks ––should meet these minimum requirements:  
 Accessibility  –– Keep your kit in sight near a strong exit doorway, where you can grab it 
on the way out. Don't hide your kit or place it  where it might get covered.  
 Completeness  –– Check your kit regularly to assure yourself everything your family 
needs for three days' survival ––or longer ––is in the kit and ready for use.  
 Individuality  –– Everyone in the family must have a backpack or port able system!  You 
may not be together from the outset, or you could become separated by events.  
 Personalization  –– Use the lists in this book to check and re -check what you may need. 
Commercial and generic kits ––even long supply lists ––can’t presume to pro vide co m-
pletely for the unique needs of you and your family. Any kit you fail to design for your 
personal needs will just be someone else’s opinion of your needs. With experience, you 
will learn to make content adjustments  to meet y our changing needs.  
 Portability  –– Keep all kits light enough it can be carried without undue strain on your 
body ––it   may be useless if it can’t be carried by it intended user. Keep all kits tightly 
packed and as light as possible.  
 Rotation   –– Rotate food, water, batteries, a nd medications frequently, at least every 3 to 
6 months, to keep all use by  dates current. More frequent rotation for items stored in te m-
peratures exceeding 70oF would be prudent. Check all clothing articles frequently to a s-
sure continuing fit.  
 Utilizatio n –– Make sure you can operate or effectively use all items in your E/PAK . Al-
ways buy the best quality you can afford ––your life could depend on what you have in 
your kit! Don't weigh down your kit with stuff!  
 Versatility  ––Assure your kit contains supplie s for an emergency staycation  as well as 
for evacuation. You might not be able to evacuate.  Notes  14 Your Personal & Family E-PAK 
 
 
 
 
 Waterproof  –– Place all items inside individual freezer -quality Ziploc® or similar wate r-
proof plastic bags. Protect all contents from water ––whether humidity or flo odwaters!  
TO LEAVE ?… OR NOT TO LEAVE ?… THAT IS THE QUESTION ! 
 
Hopefully, most of you won’t ever need your E/PAK. However, being prepared for such an eve n-
tuality is good to ease  the mind. My personal desire is that I’ll never need my E/PAK  for an y 
emergency . Yet, it will always be in a special location in my home near a protected exit, filled with 
all the things I’d need for ― hunkering down ‖ when a natural disaster, such as a wind, ice, or snow s-
torm , or a people -caused disaster causes a power outage.  
 
Lots of people tell me they plan to ― bug out .‖ Personally, I plan to stay at home unless a life -
threatening disaster requires my departure. There is no place I want to go ––except maybe to an 
expensive hotel. However, with my personal 72 -hour kit, I could even  endure a public shelter, if 
necessary. I’ve spent a weekend in a church recreation hall during an ice storm with several other 
families ––it wasn’t too bad, except for the lack of privacy. I’ve also spent a few days at my pa r-
ents’ home  during several power  outages ––with all the kids, grandkids, and their collective dogs.  
 
But heading for the unfamiliar hills, living in the wilderness fraught with unknown dangers, cha s-
ing wild animals with switches, fending off others in a similar plight to mine ––all the wh ile trying 
to maintain an urban lifestyle does not seem a good option to me. The very thought of getting on 
the freeway or city streets during or following a disaster, competing for space with all those folks 
carrying handguns (even if they do have permits ) and other nefarious weapons, is just a little frig h-
tening. On the streets I know I cannot defend myself adequately. At home, I can maintain my ind e-
pendence as long as I have my personal provisions to sustain me until the crisis period is past.  
 
My person al plans in the case of a local disaster ––such as an electrical failure ––are to make the 
best of a bad situation, enjoy the intervention in my normally extra -long, tiring workday, and spend 
it with my wife (and the dog) in the ensuing peace and quiet ––hoping the electricity will return ––
but not too soon! . It would be a moment to take a long nap, pull out the IPod, pop the top of a can 
of sardines, get out the comfort foods and enjoy a belated vacation ––savor ing the quiet, and liste n-
ing to all those short -wave radio programs I’ve been wanting to listen to for ages…  
 
BUT, IF YOU MUST LEAVE ... 
 
However, if you must leave home unexpectedly (perhaps like those in California  who had to ev a-
cuate due to wildfires), be sure to have the following information ready to go with you:  
 
 daily contact details for family members  
 local reunion points  
 out of area contacts  
 pertinent family operating data  
 
Chart 3 (following section)  is a series of charts for accumulating  critical post -emergency and di s-
aster information . Completi ng the charts  provides you the opportunity to record what everyone in 
the family ––and perhaps, emergency personnel ––would need  concerning  the daily whereabouts of 
each family member and how they can be contacted.  
 
It might be appropriate to keep the less confidential information on the family bulletin board (in 
our house it’s the refrigerator  door! ), a copy in each E/PAK , and a copy in your wallet. It would be 
wise to  send a copy to a trusted friend or relative, your attorney, CPA, or parents. Remember to 
update this information with all members of the family or group as contact  numbers and locations 
change.  
 
Keep in mind that during times of natural or people -caused disasters, local telephone service is 
often disrupted. Therefore, each member of the house hold should have a cell phone, with the  
name, phone number, and address of a person designated as an out-of-area contact . (Note : long 
distance lines and cell phones may  remain active  during emergencies. These services wi ll normally  
be restored before resi dential lines. If separated, each family member should call the designated 
out-of-area contact and communicate his particular situation within a certain period of time, repor t-
ing his physical condition, his location, and other information as previously agr eed upon. Keep 
adequate change in your E/PAK for making pay phone calls ––if you can still find one!  Small 
change will buy small items ––if they are available .  Notes

emergency network is 
the cell phone!   72-Hr.+ Emergency/Preparedness Action Kit     15

EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS BEGINS AT HOME  
 
Summarizing all that is written in this advisory , there are some thought s every head of household 
should remember:  
 
 Responsibility begins in your own home. Each parent is responsible for protecting himself, 
his family, and his property to the best of  his ability and capability.  
 
 Preparedness demands detail planning and  preparing personal and family  resources to be able 
to: 
(1) Respond  to emergencies or disasters ,  
(2) Mitigate  the effects of  emergencies an disasters , and  
(3) Recover  from natural and  people -caused emergencies and disasters that often become our 
personal disasters.  
 
 Your  prepar edness  level  should exceed your risk level  of the expected and unexpect ed eme r-
gencies or disasters in your  particular geographic location.  
 
 Being prepared requi res learning about potential disasters and emergencies, knowing first aid, 
CPR, and other life -saving skills.  
 
 Adaptability and independence are critical qualities to develop in one’s prepar edness  efforts.  
 
 Unfortunately , self-reliance skills are not tau ght in public  schools. Home -schooled children 
have the advantage in this category. U sually self-reliance skills  are learned at the hands of a 
tough taskmaster ––bad experience!   
 
 There is no easy , quick -and-dirty, low- or no -cost way to become self -reliant.  It requires 
work ––truly meaningful effort in self -education, and often a demands a large measure of self -
denial.  
 
 Utilize all the knowledge you can gain to prepare for the disasters which could cause you and 
your family more than loss of your car, your p roperty, or your crops.  
 
When designing your personal or family’s E/PAK , remember this essential preparedness point er: 
 
There are no emergencies for those who are truly prepared!

the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
educates and empowers Americans to take some simple steps to prepare for and respond to potential emergencies, including natural disasters and terrorist attacks. Ready  
asks individuals to do three key things: get an emergency supply kit, make a family emergency plan, and be informed about the different types of emergencies that could occur and their appropriate responses.
All Americans should have some basic 
supplies on hand in order to survive for at least three days if an emergency occurs.  Following is a listing of some basic items that every emergency supply kit should include.  However, it is important that individuals review this list and consider where they live and the unique needs of their family in order to create an emergency supply kit that will meet these needs. Individuals should also consider having at least two emergency supply kits, one full kit at home and smaller portable kits in their workplace, vehicle or other places they spend time.

HOUSE AND BUILDING FIRES
A fire can engulf a structure in a matter of minutes.  Understanding the basic characteristics of fire and learning
the proper safety practices can be the key to surviving a house or building fire.Federal Emergency Management Agency
Install smoke detectors.
Check them once a month and
change the batteries at least once a
year.
Develop and practice an escape
plan.  Make sure all family
members know what to do in a
fire.
nDraw a floor plan with at least
two ways of escaping every room.
Choose a safe meeting place outside
the house.
nPractice alerting other household
members.  It is a good idea to keep
a bell and a flashlight in each
bedroom for this purpose.
nPractice evacuating the building
blindfolded.  In a real fire situation,
the amount of smoke generated by a
fire will most likely make it impos-
sible to see.
nPractice staying low to the ground
when escaping.
nFeel all doors before opening
them.  If the door is hot, get out
another way.
nLearn to stop, drop to the ground,
and roll if clothes catch fire.Post emergency numbers near
telephones.
However, be aware that if a fire
threatens your home, you should
not place the call to your emer-
gency services from inside the
home.  It is better to get out first
and place the call from some-
where else.
Purchase collapsible ladders at
hardware stores and practice
using them.
Install A-B-C type fire extin-
guishers in the home and teach
family members how to use
them.
Do not store combustible
materials in closed areas or
near a heat source.
Keep the stove area clean and clear of
combustibles such as bags, boxes, and
other appliances.  If a fire starts, put a lid
over the burning pan or use a fire
extinguisher.  Be careful.  Moving the
pan can cause the fire to spread. Never
pour water on grease fires.CookingCheck electrical wiring.
nReplace wiring if frayed or
cracked.
nMake sure wiring is not under
rugs, over nails, or in high traffic
areas.
nDo not overload outlets or
extension cords.
nOutlets should have cover
plates and no exposed wiring.
nOnly purchase appliances and
electrical devices that have a label
indicating that they have been
inspected by a testing laboratory
such as Under Laboratories (UL)
or Factory Mutual (FM).
Contact your local fire depart-
ment or American Red Cross
chapter for more information
on fire safety.EMERGENCY PUBLIC INFORMATIONGive first aid where
appropriate.
Seriously injured or burned
victims should be transported to
professional medical help
immediately.
Stay out of damaged buildings.
Return home only when local fire
authorities say it is safe.
Look for structural damage.
Check that all wiring and
utilities are safe.
Discard food that has been
exposed to heat, smoke, or
soot.
Contact insurance agent.
Don’t discard damaged goods
until after an inventory has been
taken.  Save receipts for money
spent relating to fire loss.
Smoke detectors more than double
the chance of surviving a fire.  Smoke
detectors sense abnormal amounts of
smoke or invisible combustion gases in
the air.  They can detect both smouldering
and burning fires.  At least one smoke
detector should be installed on every
level of a structure.  Test the smoke
detectors each month and replace the
batteries at least once a year.  Purchase
smoke detectors labeled by the
Underwriter’s Laboratories (UL) or
Factory Mutual (FM).Smoke DetectorsGet out as quickly and as safely
as possible.
Use the stairs to escape.
When evacuating, stay low to
the ground.
If possible, cover mouth with a
cloth to avoid inhaling smoke and
gases.
Close doors in each room after
escaping to delay the spread of
the fire.
If in a room with a closed door.
nIf smoke is pouring in around the
bottom of the door or it feels hot,
keep the door closed.
nOpen a window to escape or for
fresh air while awaiting rescue.
nIf there is no smoke at the
bottom or top and the door is not
hot, then open the door slowly.
nIf there is too much smoke or fire
in the hall, slam the door shut.
Call the fire department from a
location outside the house.

WHAT IS A FIRE? HOUSE AND BUILDING FIRES
Fire is the fourth largest accidental
killer in the United States, behind
motor vehicle accidents, falls, and
drownings.  It is also the disaster
that families are mostly likely to
experience.  Over 80 percent of all
fire deaths occur where people
sleep, such as in homes or hotels.
Most fires occur when people are
likely to be less alert such as
between midnight and morning.
Eighty-four percent of house and
building fires are accidental, such
as those caused by poor electrical
wiring or careless behavior.
However, 16 percent are set
intentionally through arson or acts
of terrorism.1.The leading cause of death in a fire is asphyxiation.  Fire
victims seldom see the flames.  Fire consumes the oxygen in
the air, thereby increasing the concentration of deadly car-
bon monoxide in the atmosphere.  Inhaling carbon monox-
ide causes a loss of consciousness or death within minutes.
2.The heat from a fire can melt clothes and scorch the
lungs in a single breath.  At floor level, temperatures average
about 90 degrees Fahrenheit, but at eye level rise to 600
degrees.
3.House fires begin with a bright flame then quickly gen-
erate a black, choking smoke.  It is nearly impossible to see
through a thick cloud of smoke, so fire drill participants
should practice evacuating buildings with their eyes closed.EMERGENCY INFORMATION
Accidental fire and explosion can strike anywhere.  Fire fatalities tend to be distributed
according to population density, i.e., those states with the largest populations tend also to
have the greatest number of fire fatalities.
EMERGENCY PUBLIC INFORMATION
1.  Publish a series on how to recognize potential fire
hazards in the home and workplace.
2.  Run a story featuring interviews with local fire
officials about how to make homes fire-safe.
3. Provide tips on conducting fire drills in the home,
mentioning the need for multiple escape routes and a
meeting place outside of the home.
4.  Highlight the importance of home smoke detectors
by running monthly “battery-check reminders.”The media can raise awareness about fire safety by providing important
information to the community.  Here are some suggestions:CAUSE OF HOME FIRE DEATHS HELP YOUR COMMUNITY GET READY

HURRICANES
Hurricanes can be dangerous killers.  Learning the hurricane warning messages and planning ahead
can reduce the chances of injury or major property damage.
Plan an evacuation route.
Contact the local emergency
management office or American
Red Cross chapter, and ask for the
community hurricane preparedness
plan.  This plan should include
information on the safest evacua-
tion routes and nearby shelters.
Learn safe routes inland.
Be ready to drive 20 to 50 miles
inland to locate a safe place.
Have disaster supplies on hand.
•Flashlight and extra batteries
•Portable, battery-operated radio
and extra batteries
•First aid kit and manual
•Emergency food and water
•Nonelectric can opener
•Essential medicines
•Cash and credit cards
•Sturdy shoes
Make arrangements for pets.
Pets may not be allowed into
emergency shelters for health and
space reasons.  Contact your local
humane society for information
on local animal shelters.
Make sure that all family
members know how to re-
spond after a hurricane.
Teach family members how and
when to turn off gas, electricity,
and water.Teach children how and when to call
9-1-1, police, or fire department and
which radio station to tune to for
emergency information.
Protect your windows.
Permanent shutters are the best
protection.  A lower-cost approach
is to put up plywood panels.  Use 1/
2 inch plywood— marine plywood
is best—cut to fit each window.
Remember to mark which board fits
which window.  Pre-drill holes
every 18 inches for screws.  Do this
long before the storm.
Trim back dead or weak
branches from trees.
Check into flood insurance.  You
can find out about the National
Flood Insurance Program through
your local insurance agent or
emergency management office.
There is normally a 5-day waiting
period before a new policy
becomes effective. Homeowners
policies do not  cover damage from
the flooding that accompanies a
hurricane.
Develop an emergency
communication plan.
In case family members are sepa-
rated from one another during a
disaster (this is a real possibility
during the day when adults are at
work and children are at school),
have a plan for getting back together.Federal Emergency Management Agency
Ask an out-of-state relative or
friend to serve as the “family
contact.”  After a disaster, it’s
often easier to call long distance.
Make sure everyone in the family
knows the name, address, and phone
number of the contact person.
Hurricane Watches
and Warnings
A hurricane watch  is issued when there
is a threat of hurricane conditions within
24-36 hours.  A hurricane warning  is
issued when hurricane conditions (winds
of 74 miles per hour or greater, or
dangerously high water and rough seas)
are expected in 24 hours or less.
DURING A HURRICANE WATCH
nListen to a battery-operated
radio or television for hurricane
progress reports.
nCheck emergency supplies.
nFuel car.
nBring in outdoor objects such
as lawn furniture, toys, and garden
tools, and anchor objects that
cannot be brought inside.
nSecure buildings by closing
and boarding up windows.
Remove outside antennas.
nTurn refrigerator and freezer
to coldest settings.  Open only
when absolutely necessary and
close quickly.nStore drinking water in clean
bathtubs, jugs, bottles, and cooking
utensils.
nReview evacuation plan.
nMoor boat securely or move it to a
designated safe place.  Use rope or
chain to secure boat to trailer.  Use
tie-downs to anchor trailer to the
ground or house.
DURING A HURRICANE WARNING
nListen constantly to a battery-
operated radio or television for
official instructions.
nIf in a mobile home, check tie-
downs and evacuate immediately.
nStore valuables and personal
papers in a waterproof container on
the highest level of your home.
nAvoid elevators.
If at home:
nStay inside, away from windows,
skylights, and glass doors.
nKeep a supply of flashlights and
extra batteries handy.  Avoid open
flames, such as candles and
kerosene lamps, as a source of
light.
nIf power is lost, turn off major
appliances to reduce power “surge”
when electricity is restored.
If officials indicate evacuation is
necessary:
nLeave as soon as possible.
Avoid flooded roads and watch
for washed-out bridges.
nSecure your home by unplugging
appliances and turning off electricity
and the main water valve.
nTell someone outside of the
storm area where you are going.
EMERGENCY PUBLIC INFORMATION
September 1993
nIf time permits, and you live in
an identified surge zone, elevate
furniture to protect it from flood-
ing or better yet, move it to a
higher floor.
nBring pre-assembled emergency
supplies and warm protective
clothing.
nTake blankets and sleeping bags
to shelter.
nLock up home and leave.
Stay tuned to local radio for
information.
Help injured or trapped persons.
nGive first aid where appropriate.
nDo not move seriously injured
persons unless they are in immedi-
ate danger of further injury.  Call
for help.
Return home only after
authorities advise that it is safe
to do so.
nAvoid loose or dangling power
lines and report them immediately
to the power company, police, or
fire department.
nEnter your home with caution.
nBeware of snakes, insects, or
animals driven to higher ground
by flood water.
nOpen windows and doors to
ventilate and dry your home.
nCheck refrigerated foods for
spoilage.
nTake pictures of the damage,
both to the house and its contents
and for insurance claims.
Drive only if absolutely
necessary and avoid flooded
roads and washed-out bridges.Mitigation
Mitigation includes any activities that
prevent an emergency, reduce the
chance of an emergency happening, or
lessen the damaging effects of unavoid-
able emergencies.  Investing in preventive
mitigation steps now such as strengthening
unreinforced masonry to withstand wind and
flooding and installing shutters on every
window will help reduce the impact of
hurricanes in the future.  For more
information on mitigation, contact your local
emergency management office.Check for gas leaks —
 If you smell gas or hear a blowing or
hissing noise, open a window and quickly
leave the building.  Turn off the gas at the
outside main valve if you can and call the
gas company from a neighbor’s home.  If
you turn off the gas for any reason, it must
be turned back on by a professional.
Look for electrical system
damage —  If you see sparks or
broken or frayed wires, or if you smell hot
insulation, turn off the electricity at the main
fuse box or circuit breaker.  If you have to
step in water to get to the fuse box or circuit
breaker, call an electrician first for advice.
Check for sewage and
water lines damage —
If you suspect sewage lines are damaged,
avoid using the toilets and call a plumber.  If
water pipes are damaged, contact the water
company and avoid using water from the
tap.  You can obtain safe water by melting
ice cubes.Inspecting Utilities in
a  Damaged HomeUse telephone only for emer-
gency calls.1.The 74 to 160 mile per hour winds of a hurricane can
extend inland for hundreds of miles. Hurricanes can spawn
tornadoes, which add to the destructiveness of the storm.
Floods and flash floods generated by torrential rains also cause
damage and loss of life.  Following a hurricane, inland streams
and rivers can flood and trigger landslides.
2.When a hurricane watch is issued, the best response is to
protect your property by boarding up windows, bringing in
outside items, and being prepared to evacuate the area as soon
as officials so advise.
3.Even more dangerous than the high winds of a hurricane is
the storm surge —a dome of ocean water that can be 20 feet
high at its peak and 50 to 100 miles wide.  The surge can
devastate coastal communities as it sweeps ashore.  Nine out of
10 hurricane fatalities are attributable to the storm surge.EMERGENCY INFORMATION
Areas in the United States vulnerable to hurricanes include the Atlantic and Gulf coasts from
Texas to Maine, the territories in the Caribbean, and tropical areas of the western Pacific,H U R R I C A N E SWHAT IS A HURRICANE?
A hurricane is a tropical storm with
winds that have reached a constant
speed of 74 miles per hour or more.
Hurricane winds blow in a large
spiral around a relatively calm
center known as the “eye.”   The
“eye” is generally 20 to 30 miles
wide, and the storm may extend
outward 400 miles.  As a hurricane
approaches, the skies will begin to
darken and winds will grow in
strength.  As a hurricane nears
land, it can bring torrential rains,
high winds, and storm surges.  A
single hurricane can last for more
than 2 weeks over open waters and
can run a path across the entire
length of the eastern seaboard.
August and September are peak
months during the hurricane
season, that lasts from June 1
When disaster strikes,
people everywhere want to
help those in need.  To en-
sure that this compassion
and generosity are put to
good use, the media can
highlight these facts:
Financial aid is the immediate need of
disaster victims.  Financial contributions
should be made through a recognized
voluntary organization to help ensure
that contributions are put to their
intended use.  At some point local
officials may ask for donations of
clothing.  However, immediately after a
disaster, relief workers usually don’t
have the time or facilities to setup
distributions channels, and too often
these items go to waste.
Before sending food donations, wait
for instructions from local officials.  If
officials ask for food, baby food is
needed first, then ready-to-eat, non-
perishable items.
Volunteers should go through a
recognized voluntary agency such as
the American Red Cross or Salvation
Army.  They know what is needed and
are prepared to deal with the need.
Local emergency services directors also
coordinate all kinds of volunteer efforts.
Organizations wishing to donate items
should first contact local officials to find
out what is needed.  Be prepared to
deliver the items to one place, tell
officials when you’ll be there, and
provide for transportation, driver, and
unloading.HOW THE PUBLIC CAN HELP
AFTER A DISASTER
nIn less than a 4 week period in
1992, two major hurricanes hit
the United States leaving an
unprecedented array of devasta-
tion.  First Hurricane Andrew
pounded parts of Florida and
Louisiana to become the most
expensive natural disaster in
U.S. history with damage
estimates in the range of $15
billion to $30 billion.  Then 3
weeks later, Hurricane Iniki
affected three Hawaiian islands
resulting in over $1 billion in
damage, particularly on Kauai.
nEighteen of the 54 direct deaths
attributed to Hurricane Andrew
occurred during the recovery
phase.  Of those identified, eight
were stress-induced heart
attacks, three were either people
falling in damaged buildings orD I D  Y O U  K N O W . . .
hit by debris while cleaning up,
and two were children who died
in fires in damaged homes.
nOn the average, 10 tropical
cyclones develop in the North
Atlantic each year.  Of these, six
may strengthen to hurricane
proportion, of which two are
likely to strike the coast of the
United States.
nHurricane winds in the northern
hemisphere circulate in a coun-
terclockwise motion around the
hurricane’s center or “eye,”
while hurricane winds in the
southern hemisphere circulate
clockwise.
nThe Galveston, Texas, hurricane
in 1900 was the natural disaster
that resulted in the most deaths
in United States history.  This
hurricane took 6,000 lives.The media can raise awareness about hurricanes by providing  important
information to the community.  Here are some suggestions:
1.  Publish a special section in your local newspaper with
emergency information on hurricanes.  Localize the informa-
tion by printing the phone numbers of local emergency
services offices, the American Red Cross, and hospitals.
2.  Provide hurricane tracking charts to local schools.
3.  Work with local emergency services and American Red
Cross officials to prepare special reports for people with mobility
impairments on what to do if an evacuation is ordered.
4.  Stage a simulated evacuation to show your community what
can happen.
5.  Periodically inform your community of local public warning
systems.

"DEPARTRMENT: AGRICULTURE
Fighting fire
Fire can cause serious damage on a farm. It can
destroy crops and grazing for animals.
People or animals can get injured or may even die in the  fire.
Only one match can destroy thousands of trees and
large areas of farmland.
zMost crop fires occur before or soon afterharvesting. At this time the crops areusually ripe and dry andburn easily. When cropshave lost their greencolour,leaves wilt and theears droop, fires can beexpected.
zIf a fire breaks out in a barn,remove the unburnt materialas quickly as possible toprevent the fire fromspreading.
zWhen the wind is blowing,especially in August, firescan start and spread very easily.2How to prevent fires
zChildren should not play with matches.
zDo not throw burning matches or cigarettes
into dry grass, leaves, bushes or barns.
zDo not throw cigarette stubs out of a car window.
zMake sure that all fires areput out properly.
zUse sand to put out a fire.
zDo not make open fires inthe veld.
zNever light fires in theopen during windyweather.
zNever leave a fire without putting itout or asking someone to keep an eye.
If you see a fire
zIf you see a veld fire, report it immediately to
your neighbours and the local fire warden. Tellthem exactly where the fire is.
zLeave someone at home to give people
information about the fire. If you have a radioor telephone, the lines must be kept open sothat new information can be passed on as soonas it is received.
zGo back immediately to the spot where you saw the fire. Takealso basic equipment to fight the fire with.XXXXXXXXXX3
zIf you are not the landowner, inform him or her about the exact
position of the fire.
zWhen you arrive at the fire, organise the firefighters as soon aspossible. If you have a radio keep the person on standby at homeupdated on the situation so that the fire warden and neighbours
can be alerted.
zIf possible, take a notebook with you andwrite down the details of the fire.
zRemove all farm animals and equipment toa safe place.
zThrow water onto the fire as soon as possible.
Tools (equipment) you canuse to put out a fire
zHoses
zFire extinguishers —water
or dry-powder type
zMake fire swatters  from old beltings (strips of rubber) or wet
sacks. Beating the fire with the beltings or wet sacks takes away
the air (oxygen) which the fire needs to burn. If there is notenough air, the fire will smother and die slowly.
zUse rucksack pumps  to wet the
plants and grass near and in front
of the fire. Rucksack pumps are
also useful when checking forflare-ups after the fire has been
put out.
zUse water containers  and
a waterpump  that can supply
enough water.
4zShovels, rakes  and spades
can be used to make afirebreak quickly. A counter
fire can be made from this
break. A break is a clean stripof land, almost like a road.
zUse shovels and rakes toput out the fire with sand
and soil. Use them also
to remove dry grass and
twigs which can burneasily.
zUse hand slashers  to cut unburnt grass and plants before an
oncoming fire.
zUse fire swatters  (leafy branches or sacks fitted to the end of
wooden sticks).
Food and water
Arrange for food and drinking water
to be taken to the scene of the firefor the firefighters. It is a good ideato keep a supply of  food, such asdry biscuits, tinned food (bullybeef,beans in tomato sauce, tuna,tomatoes and onions),maize-meal and instantcold drinks ready in caseof emergency.
Remember that the
firefighters can getvery tired.
5Fighting the fire
zDo not allow too many people
in the area.
zThe firefighters should
work short shifts (periods).
Those in front should be
replaced at short intervals.
zApproach the fire from one or
both sides and try to narrow the front of the fire.
zIf there is a fire-belt (break) or a natural barrier such as a river,try to narrow the fire against the barrier.
zSet upt firefighters at strategic placed to put out
sparks carried by the wind. Strong wind can
carry sparks as far as 1 km.
zUse waterpumps to cool down the flames and to enable the
beaters to reach the fire and put out the smouldering material.
zIt is important to beat inwards to the burning area so that
sparks are not blown into grass and leaves that are notburning yet.
zA clean break must be raked or hoedbehind the firefighters to separate theburnt area from unburnt plants. Throw
the leaves and grass that you have
raked or hoed into the burnt area.
zMonitor the wind direction at all times.
zCarry a whistle. This may help you to give thefirefighters basic signals.6Back-burning
If the wind is very strong and it is impossible to stop the fire by direct
beating, back-burning may be considered as a last resort. Back-burning can be very dangerous. A back-burn is a new fire from theopposite direction to meet the fire that is already burning.
zIt is very important to ensure that no-one comes between the fireand the back-burn.
zBack-burn from the road, fire-belt or natural barrier well aheadof the fire.
zBurn only a very narrow strip at a time and slowly widen the strip.
zDo not let the back-burn fire flare up and throw sparks—ratherdampen the grass and leaves with water, or put out the fire if it
seems too dangerous, before continuing.Wind direction

"Fire Safety and Extinguishers 
Types of Extinguishers 
With so many fire extinguishers to choose from, se lecting the proper one for your home can be a daunting 
task. Everyone should have at least one fire extinguisher  at home, but it's just as important to ensure you 
have the proper type of fire extinguis her. Fire protection experts recomme nd one for the kitchen, the garage 
and workshop. 
Fire extinguishers are divided into four  categories, based on different types of fires. Each fire extinguisher 
also has a numerical rating that serves as a guide fo r the amount of fire the extinguisher can handle. The 
higher the number, the more fire-fighting power. The follo wing is a quick guide to help choose the right type of 
extinguisher.  
 • Class A  extinguishers are for ordinary combustible materials such as 
paper, wood, cardboard, and most plasti cs. The numerical rating on these 
types of extinguishers indicates the amount of water it holds and the 
amount of fire it can extinguish.  
• Class B  fires involve flammable or combustible liquids such as gasoline, 
kerosene, grease and oil. The numer ical rating for class B extinguishers 
indicates the approximate number of square feet of fire it can extinguish.  
• Class C  fires involve electrical equipment, such as appliances, wiring, 
circuit breakers and outlets. Never use water to extinguish class C fires - the risk of electrical shock is fa r too great! Class C extinguishers do not 
have a numerical rating. The C classification means the extinguishing 
agent is non-conductive. 
• Class D  fire extinguishers are commonly found in a chemical laboratory. 
They are for fires that involve combustible metals, such as magnesium, titanium, potassium and sodium. These types of extinguishers also have no 
numerical rating, nor are they giv en a multi-purpose rating - they are 
designed for class D fires only.
 
Some fires may involve a combination of these classi fications. Your fire extinguishers should have ABC 
ratings on them.  
Here are the most common types of fire extinguishers:  
• Water extinguishers  or APW extinguishers (air-pressurized water) are suitable for class A fires 
only. Never use a water extinguisher on grease fires, el ectrical fires or class D fires - the flames will 
spread and make the fire bigger! Water extinguishers are filled with water and pressurized with 
oxygen. Again - water extinguishers can be very danger ous in the wrong type of situation. Only fight 
the fire if you're certain it contains  ordinary combustible materials only. 
• Dry chemical  extinguishers come in a variety of types and are suitable for a combination of class A, 
B and C fires . These are filled with foam or powder and pressurized with nitrogen.  
o BC - This is the regular type of dry chemical ex tinguisher. It is filled with sodium bicarbonate 
or potassium bicarbonate. The BC variety l eaves a mildly corrosive residue which must be 
cleaned immediately to prevent any damage to materials.  
o ABC  - This is the multipurpose dry chemical  extinguisher. The ABC type is filled with 
monoammonium phosphate, a yellow powder that leaves a sticky residue that may be 
damaging to electrical appliances such as a computer  
Dry chemical extinguishers have an advantage over CO2 extinguishers since they leave a non-flammable 
substance on the extinguished material, reducing the likelihood of re-ignition.  
• Carbon Dioxide (CO2) extinguishers  are used for class B and C fires . CO2 extinguishers contain 
carbon dioxide, a non-flammable gas, and are highly pres surized. The pressure is so great that it is 
not uncommon for bits of dry ice to shoot out the nozzle. They don't work very well on class A fires 
because they may not be able to displace enough oxygen to put the fire out, causing it to re-ignite.  
CO2 extinguishers have an advantage over dry chem ical extinguishers since they don't leave a harmful 
residue - a good choice for an electrical fire on a computer  or other favorite electronic device such as a stereo 
or TV. 
 
It is vital to know what type of extinguisher you are using. Using the wrong type of extinguisher for 
the wrong type of fire can be life-threatening.  
These are only the common types of fi re extinguishers. There are many ot hers to choose from. Base your 
selection on the classification and the extinguisher's compatibility with the items you wish to protect.  
Fire needs fuel, oxygen and heat in order to burn. In simple terms, fire extinguishers remove one of these 
elements by applying an agent that eit her cools the burning fuel, or removes or displaces the surrounding 
oxygen. 
Fire extinguishers are filled with wate r or a smothering material, such as CO2. By pulling out the safety pin 
and depressing the lever at the top of the cylinder (the body  of the extinguisher), this material is released by 
high amounts of pressure.  
How it Works  
At the top of the cylinder, there is a smaller cylinder filled with compressed gas. A release valve acts as a 
locking mechanism and prevents this gas from escaping.  When you pull the safety pin and squeeze the lever, 
the lever pushes on an actuating rod which presses the valve down to  open a passage to the nozzle. The 
compressed gas is released, applying a downward pressure  on the fire-extinguishing material. This pushes 
the material out the nozzle with high amounts of pressure.  
Although the temptation is to aim the extinguisher at the flames, the proper way to use the extinguisher is to 
aim it directly at the fuel. 
Water Extinguishers  
Water extinguishers are filled with regular tap water a nd pressurized with oxygen. The best way to remove 
heat is to dump water on the fire but, depending on the ty pe of fire, this is not always the best option.  
Dry Chemical Extinguishers  
Dry chemical extinguishers are filled with either foam or  powder, usually sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) or 
potassium bicarbonate, and pressurized with nitrogen. Baking soda is effective because it decomposes at 158 
degrees Fahrenheit and releases carbon dioxide (which smothers oxygen) once it decomposes. Dry chemical 
extinguishers interrupt the chemical reaction of the fire by  coating the fuel with a thin layer of powder or foam, 
separating the fuel from the surrounding oxygen.  
Carbon Dioxide (CO2) extinguishers  
CO2 extinguishers contain carbon dioxide, a non-flammabl e gas, and are highly pressurized. The pressure is 
so great that it is not uncommon for bits of dry ice to shoot out. CO2 is heavier than oxygen so these 
extinguishers work by displacing or taking away oxygen from the surrounding area. CO2 is also very cold so it 
also works by cooling the fuel.  
     Using Extinguishers 
Before using your fire extinguisher, be sure to read the instructions before it's too late. Although there are 
many different types of fire extinguishers, all of them operate in a similar manner.  
Use this acronym as a quick reference (it is a good idea to  print this reference and pin it next to your fire 
extinguisher): 
P A S S 
Pull the Pin  at the top of the extinguisher. The pin rel eases a locking mechanism and will allow you to 
discharge the extinguisher.  
Aim at the base of the fire,  not the flames. This is important - in order to put out the fire, you must 
extinguish the fuel.  
Squeeze the lever slowly.  This will release the extinguishing agent in the extinguisher. If the handle is 
released, the discharge will stop.  
Sweep from side to side.  Using a sweeping motion, move the fire extinguisher back and forth until the fire is 
completely out. Operate the extinguisher from a safe distance, several feet away, and then move towards the 
fire once it starts to diminish. Be sure to read the in structions on your fire extinguisher - different fire 
extinguishers recommend operating them from different di stances. Remember: Aim at the base of the fire, not 
at the flames!!!! 
 A typical fire extinguisher contains 10 seconds of ex tinguishing power. This could be less if it has already 
been partially discharged. Always read the instructions t hat come with the fire extinguisher beforehand and 
become familiarized with its parts. It is highly recomm ended by fire prevention experts that you get hands-on 
training before operating a fire extinguisher. Most  local fire departments offer this service.  
Once the fire is out, don't walk away! Watch the area fo r a few minutes in case it re-ignites. Recharge the 
extinguisher immediately after use.  
Maintaining Extinguishers 
Inspect fire extinguishers  at least once a month (more often in severe environments). 
Fire extinguisher maintenance  is important for everyone’s safety.  
If the extinguisher is damaged or needs recharging , replace it immediately! 
You must ensure that: 
• The extinguisher is not blocked by equipment, coats or  other objects that could interfere with access 
in an emergency. 
• The pressure is at the recommended level. On extinguishers equipped with a gauge (such as that 
shown on the right), the needle should be in the green zone - not too high and not too low. 
• The nozzle or other parts are not hindered in any way. 
• The pin and tamper seal (if it has one) are intact. 
• There are no dents, leaks, rust, chemical deposits  and/or other signs of abuse/wear. Wipe off any 
corrosive chemicals, oil, gunk etc. t hat may have deposited on the extinguisher. 
Some manufacturers recommend shaking your dry chem ical extinguishers once a month to prevent the 
powder from settling/packing.  
Fire extinguishers should be pressure tested (a process called hydrostatic testing) after a number of years to 
ensure that the cylinder is safe to use. Consult your owner's manual, extinguisher label or the manufacturer to 
see when yours may need such testing.   
IMPORTANT: Recharge all extinguishers immediately after use regardless of how much they were 
used.  
An inspection is a “quick check” to give reasonable as surance that a fire extinguisher is available, fully 
charged and operable. The value of an inspection lies in the frequency, regularity, and thoroughness with 
which it is conducted. The frequency will vary from ho urly to monthly, based on the needs of the situation. 
Inspections should always be conducted when extinguisher s are initially placed in service and thereafter at 
approximately 30-day intervals.  
 
MAINTENANCE   
Fire extinguishers should be maintained at regular inte rvals (at least once a year), or when specifically 
indicated by an inspection. Maintenance is a “thorou gh check” of the extinguisher. It is intended to give 
maximum assurance that an extinguisher will operat e effectively and safely. It includes a thorough 
examination and any necessary repair, recharging or  replacement. It will normally reveal the need for 
hydrostatic testing of an extinguisher. 
Location of Extinguishers 
Having a fire extinguisher is one thing, having it  handy in case of an emergency, is another.  
It is recommended to have at least one fire extinguisher on each floor of your home. Also, keep them in plain 
sight and no more than five feet above the floor. Do not put them in closets because that will cost you 
valuable time when you are reaching for it. And even though a fire extinguisher may not match your décor, do not put it behind curtains or drapes.  
The most important places to have a fire extinguisher ar e in areas that are more susceptible to fire. These 
areas are the kitchen and the garage.  
Kitchen:  According to U.S. Fire Administration statistics, t he kitchen is the place where fires most often start. 
If you have a fire extinguisher in the kitchen, most gr ease fires can be contained. Do not put the fire 
extinguisher near the stove as it will be out of your reach if the fire is on the stovetop. You should not have to 
risk burns just to reach your extinguisher. Therefore, t he best place to put the fire  extinguisher is by the door 
of the kitchen so you have easy access to it.  
Garage:  It is a good idea to keep a fire extinguisher here beca use in most homes, this is the place we use as 
storage. Often, leftover paints, solvents, and buildi ng materials will be piled up without a second thought. 
Again, the best location to mount t he fire extinguisher is by the door.  
Fire Prevention 
The National Fire Protection Association reports 85% of  fire deaths occur in the home, making fire prevention 
a top priority in every home. Here is a list of some of  the less obvious tips for fire prevention, based on the 
most common causes of fires:  
Cooking equipment  
• Keep appliances clean, and wipe surfaces after sp ills. Clean stove surfaces and ovens regularly.  
• Wear tight-fitting sleeves, or roll them up when cooking  
• Keep flammable objects, including pot holders, dish towe ls and curtains, at least three feet away from 
the stove.  
• Wood and coal stoves, fireplaces, chimneys, and all other solid-fueled heating equipment needs to be 
inspected annually by a professional and cleaned accordingly.  
• Assure microwaves have enough room to breathe, t hat all the vents are cl eared of obstructions. 
• If there is a microwave fire, keep the door closed and unplug the microwave. Make sure to have the 
microwave oven serviced be fore you use it again.  
• If there is an oven fire, keep the door closed a nd turn off the heat. If the fire doesn't go out 
immediately, call the fire department. • A grease fire occurs when oil or greasy foods are heated and ignite. The simplest way to fight a 
grease fire is to carefully slide a lid over the pan. Turn off the burner, don't move the pan, and keep 
the lid on until the pan cools completely. Baking Soda may also be used to suffocate the fire. 
NEVER PUT WATER ON A GREASE FIRE . Water causes the grease to splatter and the fire to 
spread. Also, NEVER attempt to ta ke a grease fire outdoors. It will be too hot to carry and you will 
drop it, causing a major house fire.  
Heating Equipment  
 
• Heating equipment is the leading cause of home fire s during the winter months of December, January 
and February, and is the second leading cause of home fires year round. 
• When buying heaters, look for devices with automatic shutoff features.  
• Be sure any gas-fueled heating device is installed with proper attention to ventilation, and never put 
un-vented gas space heaters in bedrooms or bathro oms. Liquefied Petroleum (LP) gas heaters with 
self-contained fuel supplies are prohibited for home use by NFPA codes.  
• Never leave space heaters on when you leave the room.  
• Space heaters should be kept at least thr ee feet away from anything that can burn. 
• Don't use extension cords with space heaters. The hi gh amount of current they require could melt the 
cord and start a fire.  
• When lighting a gas space heater, strike y our match first, then turn on the gas.  
• Never use a gas range as a substitute for a furnace or space heater.  
   
Electrical Distribution Equipment  
• Wiring, outlets, switches, circuit breakers and other electrical devices are the third leading cause of 
home fires and the second leading cause of fire deaths.  
• Replace or repair loose or frayed cords on all electrical devices.  
• If outlets or switches feel warm, shut off the circuit and have them checked by an electrician.  
• Try to avoid extension cords. If y ou feel an extension cord is necessary, make sure that it is not 
frayed or worn. Do not run it under carpet or around doorways. 
• Never overload a socket. The use of ""octopus"" out lets or ""power bar"", outlet extensions that 
accommodate several plugs, is strongly discourage d. Try to limit one high-wattage appliance into 
each individual outlet at a time. 
• If a circuit breaker trips or a fuse blows frequently , cut down on the number of appliances on that line. 
In many older homes, the capacity of the wiring system has not kept pace with today's modern 
appliances and can overload electrical systems. Some overload signals include: dimming lights when 
an appliance goes on, fuses blowing fre quently or shrinking TV picture.  
• Assure there's plenty of air space around home enter tainment units such as the TV and stereo to 
avoid overheating.  
Although some fires are caused by electrical system failures and appliance defects, many are caused by the 
misuse and poor maintenance of electrical appliances , incorrectly installed wiring, and overloaded circuits and 
extension cords.   Other Sources  
 
• Never smoke in bed. Always look under cushions and in trashcans for burning cigarettes before going 
to bed. Check carpeting where ashtrays have been used. 
• Get rid of stored newspaper or other unnecessary materials. Newspapers stored in a damp, warm 
place may ignite spontaneously.  
• Install smoke detectors on every level of your home and outside of sleeping areas.  
• Mount a fire extinguisher in the kitchen, garage and workshop.  
• Agree in advance on an escape plan. There shou ld be at least two exits in every room. 
 
Note:  Half of all home fire deaths occur at night, so fire hazard checks and special attention to fire prevention 
should occur before going to bed.    Fighting a Fire 
All fires can be very dangerous and life-threatening. Y our safety should always be your primary concern when 
attempting to fight a fire.  
Before deciding to fight a fire, be certain that:  
• The fire is small and not spreading. A fire can double in size within two or three minutes.  
• You have the proper fire extinguisher for what is burning.  
• The fire won't block your exit if you can't control it. A good way to ensure this is to keep the exit at 
your back.  
• You know your fire extinguisher works. Inspect exti nguishers once a month for dents, leaks or other 
signs of damage. Assure the pressure is at the recommended level. On extinguishers equipped with a 
gauge, the needle should be in the green zone - not too high and not too low.  
• You know how to use your fire extinguisher. There's not enough time to read instructions when a fire 
occurs.  
How to Fight a Fire Safely:  
 
• Always stand with an exit at your back.  
• Stand several feet away from the fire, moving closer once the fire starts to diminish.  
• Use a sweeping motion and aim at the base of the fire.  
• If possible, use a ""buddy system"" to have someone back you up or call for help if something goes 
wrong.  
• Be sure to watch the area for awhile to ensure it doesn't re-ignite.  
 
Never Fight A Fire If:  
• The fire is spreading rapidly.  Only use a fire extinguisher when the fire is in its early stages. If the 
fire is already spreading quickly, evacuate and call the fire department.  
• You don't know what is burning.  Unless you know what is burning, you won't know what type of fire 
extinguisher to use. Even if you have an ABC exti nguisher, there could be something that will explode 
or produce highly toxic smoke.  
• You don't have the proper fire extinguisher.  The wrong type of extinguisher can be dangerous or 
life-threatening. 
• There is too much smoke or you are at risk of inhaling smoke.  Seven out of ten fire-related 
deaths occur from breathing poisono us gases produced by the fire. 
Any sort of fire will produce some amount of carbon  monoxide, the most deadly gas produced by a fire. 
Materials such as wool, silk, nylon and some plastics can produce other highly toxic gases such as carbon 
dioxide, hydrogen cyanide, or hydrogen chlori de. Beware - all of these can be fatal.  
Smoke inhalation or exposure to fire itself can be lif e threatening so get educated about the basics in CPR 
and burn treatment.  "

Flooding on Your Property 
 
Should you r home o r othe r stru ctures be locate d in a n area where flooding a bove first floor le vel 
is forec ast, you may wish to do the following:  
 
√ Listen careful ly to the forecast and d etermine ho w hig h the predi cted flood level will 
be, then allo w an extra m etre of  cove rage beyon d that height 
√ Remove all v aluabl es fro m basem ent, turn  off and discon nect all powe r and g as lines 
and re move a ll electri c motors from the furna ce and applian ces which will remai n in 
the basement  during the flo oding p eriod. 
√ Secu rely plug  all basem ent drain s and o utlets su ch as: sewe r drain s, sinks, toilet  
bowls and lau ndry outlets t o the se wer. I t may be necessary to plu g some o utlets 
below the level of the wee ping tile drai ns, in the prim ary se wer trap. Effective plugs 
can b e made from wo od or plasti c bag s. All plugs mu st be held in pl ace by sand bags 
or othe r heav y materials, o r held in pla ce by braces secu rely faste ned to floor jo ists. 
√ Move all possession s withi n the stru cture above the p rojected flood  water level 
√ Prepa re sand bag-wall a round your p roperty (se e sandbag dy kes) 
√ Remov e lawn furniture 
√ Move small er outhou ses to higher g round and a way from potentiall y eroding 
riverbanks.  
 
SANDBAG DYKES   
 
Construction of a sand bag dyke re quires spe cial procedures to a chieve maximu m stren gth 
and effective ness. Should you cho ose to con struct a sandbag dyke to prote ct your p roperty in 
the event of a flood, the followin g tips ma y be useful.  
 
1. Strip the sod or g round cover b eneath the area fo r the propo sed dyke and di g a ""bonding 
trench"" one sack in depth and two sacks wid e as a fo undatio n for the dyke structure.  
 
2. To effectively provide p rotection fro m the fo rces of floodin g wate r a dyke mu st be three 
times a s wide  at its base a s it is high. A dyke inten ded to be one m etre high m ust have a 
three met re wide ba se.  
 
3. Sandbag s should neve r be filled more  than half-full and mu st be laid in altern ating 
crisscross direction s. The base level sh ould be laid parallel to the flow of the wat er, the 
second level sho uld be lai d perp endicular to the flow,  with the third  level again la id parall el, 
contin uing to the intende d height of the dyke. Each succe ssive lay er is set ba ck one-h alf 
sandbag widt h on both si des in ea ch additional layer.  A side view of a complete d dyke would 
show a triangular cross section.  
 
4. Individual bag s nee d not be tied shut. Overlappi ng by succe ssive bag s will ho ld the san d in 
place. The m ethod of ke eping bag conte nts in pla ce is called ""lap ping.""

May 20 07 - 7 -Polyethylene Sheeting 
Flooding Above First Floor Level 
 
   
 
 
POLYETH YLENE SH EETING   
 
A reliab le source of  protection  for the stru cture of your  home an d most other smaller buildings during 
severe flooding conditions is the pro per use of polyeth ylene (p lastic) sh eetin g.  
 
The following is a brief description of how, according to dyking engineers , an individual can provide 
protectio n to his or her home should po tential flood ing conditions be considered seve re enough to require 
evacuati on.  
 
This system  has bee n success fully use d throughout Cana da and the United States, and is recommende d for 
structures l ocated in areas  where fl ood depth is anticipat ed to  extend above the lev el of the stru cture's first 
floor. It is not considere d necessary in areas  where only basement flooding is expected.  
 
Polyeth ylene sheetin g is in tended to  add extra pro tection  to the building's stru cture, but ""sheeted "" buildings 
are not considered su itable to live in once the sheetin g has b een completed. Use this procedure only if 
evacuati on is a nticipated.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
  
 
 
May 20 07 - 8 -Procedure:   
 
The e xterior lower levels of a home to be evacuated are wrapped in polyethylene s heeting, secured at joints 
with nailed strips of wood and anchored around the structure's fou ndation with sandbags or other heavy 
objects.  
 
For greatest protection, the use of 6-mil polyethylene s heets in 3 metre widths is recom mende d.  
 
Step-by-Step I nstruc tions:   
 
Should your  home or other structures be located  in an area where flooding above first floor level is forecast, 
you m ay wish to do the following:  
 
1. Listen care fully to  the forecas t and 
determine how high the predicted flood 
level will b e, then allo w an ex tra m etre 
of coverage beyond that height.  
 
2. Remove al l valuables from basement, 
turn off and disconnect all power and 
gas lines  and remove all electric m otors 
from  the furna ce and a pplia nces which 
will rem ain in the basement during the 
flooding period.  
 
3. Secu rely plug all basem ent drains and 
outlets such as: sewe r drains, sinks, 
toilet b owls and  laund ry outlets to  the 
sewer. It may be necessa ry to plug some 
outlets below t he lev el of the weep ing 
tile d rains, in th e primary sewer trap. 
Effect ive plugs can be m ade from wood 
or plastic bags. All plugs must be held 
in place by sa ndba gs or other heavy 
materials, or held in place by braces  
securely  fasten ed to  floor joists.  
 
4. Move  all posse ssions  within the 
structure a bove the projected flood 
water lev el.  
 
5. Flood the basement with clear water 
from an outside tap  through a basement 
wind ow. Bring water lev el insid e the 
basement to window casem ent level.  
 6. Board up all windows, doors and  other 
openings.  
 
7. For additional protectio n against the 
force of outside flood waters, brace the  
walls of th e stru cture fro m the inside by 
nailing ""t wo-by-six"" lengths or planking 
one metre above the  floor. Once the  
two-by-si x ""walers"" are  .in pl ace, add 
braces  constructed from  strips of two-
by-fours, runn ing at a 45 de gree angle 
from  the ""walers"" to  the floor and hold 
in place with either sa ndba gs, or 
wooden blocks nailed directly to the 
floor.  
 
8. Apply the polyeth ylene barrier loo sely 
to the exterior walls of th e stru cture, 
starting at a hei ght of one meter above 
the pred icted  flood level. Allow an  
additional one metre at th e base of th e 
structure for anch oring . At joints in th e 
sheeting, allow a minimum one metre 
overlap. Place sandba gs around the 
house  agai nst the polyethylene. Stack 
the bags in an overlapping fashion and 
at least 10 bags high.  
9. At the base of the first stack of 
sandbags lift t he rem aining 
polyethylene sheetin g up and cover the 
outside face of the initial sandb ags, hold 
the plastic sh eetin g in place with  a 
second wall of san dbags.

ADDITIONAL CONSI DERATIONS FOR HOUSEHOL DERS   
 
Additional co nsideratio ns for hou seholders to h elp prevent flood d amage in clude:  
a. If eaves troug hs are co nnected to the ho use sewer system, discon nect them an d re-
channel the fl ow to point s more tha n 1.3 metr es from the buildin g's foun datio ns. Thi s will 
help re duce the flow of wat er into the co mmunity se wage sy stem..  
 
b. Dangerou s chemicals such as weed killer, inse cticides and corro sives sh ould b e 
remove d to dry area s to re duce the dan gers of chemical contamin ation, fires, e xplosio ns 
and pe rsonal injurie s..  
 
c. Buoyant material s should be rem oved from the ba sement to lesse n the potentia l for 
damag e to first floor comp onent s of the st ructure sh ould the ba sement flood..  
 
If you plug the basement sewe r, be su re to remo ve the toilet bowl from any ba sement bathroo m 
and plu g that se wer d rain secu rely as well.  
 
If, through taste, colour or odour you suspect your drinking water i s contami nated, do not drink it.  
 
Contami nated drinking water may be pu rified by  boilin g, by adding purification ta blets (if 
available ), or by adding h ousehold ble ach. In most  situations a dding two drop s of normal strength 
bleach to ea ch litre of wate r is re comme nded. Allow t he treated water to stand fo r at least 30 
minutes b efore drin king. 
 
ELECTRICAL POWER   
 
In any area where imm ediate flooding is anticip ated, it is essential t o shut off all electri cal power. 
In an urba n area ho meowners are advised to s hut off the power by openi ng the main se rvice 
switch. In a suburban o r rural area the yard switch m ust be op ened.  
 
Entry into a floode d roo m or ba sement whe re ele ctrical po wer is b elieved to still  be active sh ould 
never, und er any circum stances, be att empted. Wh en discon necting the po wer source it is 
essential to b e standi ng on  a dry platform. Av oid approa ching any maste r switch  if it is 
surro unded by water. The switch may b e open ed through the u se of a non-con ductive dry 
material such as a dry woo den sti ck or insul ated tool of some sort.  
 
An additional precautio n you are to consi der if invo lved in rescu e work, o r if you are returni ng to 
property aba ndon ed du ring a flood, con cerns p ossible subm erged electri cal cables. In som e 
flooded a reas water level s may rea ch or subm erge po wer b earing e lectrical cable s. Whe n 
operating a b oat in flooded  area s extrem e cautio n must be exercised to avoid coming into co ntact 
with ""live"" wires .  
 
If your home is threat ened by immediate  flooding it is importa nt not only to be pre pared for the 
first line of flooding, but to make a s many prepa rations as p ossible for the retu rn to normal livi ng 
once the floo d has subsided.    
  
 
 
May 20 07 - 11 - 
Some things  to consider inc lude:  
a. If appliances such as deep freeze rs, furnac es, washe rs and drye rs can n ot be moved 
above the ant icipate d flood  level, then electri cal controls an d motors, sho uld be removed 
to prevent wa ter dama ge and expen sive repai rs. If an electri cal motor ha s bee n 
subm erged in  water no atte mpt shoul d be made to op erate it until a complete ov erhaul 
and cl eanin g has b een completed.  
 
b. All insulation of thermally insul ated ap pliances mu st be repl aced b efore op eration if the 
applia nces have been p artially or com pleted su bmerged. The se applian ces inclu de: 
water h eaters, refrige rators, freeze rs and range s. (Not e: With the prese nt cost of parts 
and lab our, repairs to su ch applia nces may not be practical.)  
 
c. Electri c baseboard heate rs and p ortable heater s mu st be moved above water l evel. It is 
doubtful such  items co uld be ren dered safe for o peration on ce su bmerged.  
 
d. Portable el ectric ap plian ces such as kitchen blen ders a nd mixers, as well as p ower tools 
must be kept dry, or not op erated u ntil completely dri ed, clea ned a nd overh auled.  
 
e. Radios, televi sions, ste reo system s and other ho me el ectro nic syste ms mu st be moved 
above the flo od level. Rep airs to such item s follo wing subme rsion i s not practi cal.  
 
In orde r to prevent fires o r dang erous short circuit s all wirin g in hom es an d other building s which 
have bee n partially or com pletely floode d must be inspecte d before  being pla ced back in se rvice.  
 
 
 
 
GAS FIRED APPLIANCE S  
 
Ideally, if enough adva nce warning i s provided of  a potential flood,  homeo wners shoul d have a 
profe ssional contracto r remove elect ric motor, bur ners an d controls. If such hel p is not availa ble, 
these a re the steps you ma y wish to take :  
1. Shut off the supply of all electri cal po wer to the applia nce a nd leav e it off.  
 
2. Shut off the gas supply val ve to the applianc e. These valves are u sually in the gas line 
near the b ottom of the app liance.  
 
3. On wa rm air circulatin g furnaces remov e the electri c fan motor an d, if possibl e, the fan 
unit as well.  
 
4. For a hot water ci rculating system, re move the circula ting pump mo tor, but do no t try to 
remove the p ump unit from  the piping sy stem.  
   
  
 
 
May 20 07 - 12 -5. If advance warnin g time al lows for the remo val of ga s fired clothe s drye rs, rang es an d 
other such ap plian ces it is essen tial to shut o ff the gas v alve. It is also esse ntial to cap 
the open e nd of the pipe le ading fro m the valve to the applian ce to prevent the b ack flow 
of flood water into the gas piping system . This  may be  accompli shed by using pl ugs o r 
pipe cap s available at mo st hard ware and plumbi ng store s.  
 
6. If the hot water tank cannot be moved, do not drain. S hut off pipes l eadin g to and  from it 
and leave it in place.  
 
Once the floo d waters hav e sub sided, d o not a ttempt to place g as applia nces back in se rvice  
yourself. This work  mus t be c arried out by a licen sed pipe fitter.  
 
 
OIL FIRED APPLIANCES   
 
As in the ca se of gas ap pliances, all work in  preparing for a flood sh ould be carrie d out by a 
profe ssional. If this is not possible, he re are so me steps you may take to p rotect  your home a nd 
property.  
1. Shut off electrical supply to all equipment and leave it off.  
 
2. Remove the oil burn er and ignition tran sforme r, or, if possibl e, rem ove the entire  burne r 
unit. If the c omplete burner unit is  removed, c ap the copper oil fue l line to ensu re it is 
water tight. T urn off the fuel line at the tank.  
 
3. For force d air furnaces, re move the fan motor an d the fan unit, if p ossible.  
 
4. On hot wate r boilers eq uipped with a circulatin g pum p, remove the  pump motor,  but do 
not attempt to remove the pu mp from the  piping sy stem.  
 
5. Remove the controls fo r the stack, high l imit and fan.  
 
6. If the height of the flood wa ters ex ceed s the top of the tank, dama ge may result a s the 
floating tank exerts p ressure on floo r joists an d component s to the building a bove. To 
prevent this consi der the fo llowing:  
 
 
a. Remove oil le vel gauge a nd plug op ening with the pro per si zed thre aded pl ug.  
 
b. Fill the tank with oil.  
 
c. Place at lea st 136 kg of we ight on top of  the tank. San dbag s are ide al. If the tank 
is only half filled, a minimu m of 544 kg o f sandb ags will be requi red.  
 
d. As previo usly noted, shut o ff valve at the base of the tank.  
 
   
  
 
 
May 20 07 - 13 -PROPANE  TANKS   
 
Although lo cated outsid e the st ructure, propa ne tan ks can cause damage, potenti al for 
devastatin g explosio ns if ru ptured a nd ex posed to a spark. Such tanks are costly to repla ce as 
well.  
 
Becau se propane i s considerably less den se than water, even a full tank is extremely buoya nt. 
Secu re an choring i s a ne cessity for flood con ditions.  
 
Here are s ome s teps for you to follow:  
1. Turn off the valve at the tank.  
 
2. Disco nnect tubing to tank a nd se curely p lug it.  
 
3. Fasten a cabl e, heavy rope  or chai n arou nd the tank a nd se cure the  other end to a pole, 
building o r substantial structure to p revent the tank fro m floating away.  
Once the floo d waters hav e gone d own, call a pro pane installe r to have the tank prope rly and 
safely re -installed an d connecte d to the applia nces for whic h it is  a fuel s ource. Do not attempt to 
do the re -connectio n yourself. 
 
 
IF YOU MUST LEAVE YOUR HOME   
 
If rising flood waters threat en the safety of y ou and your family and you must eva cuate you r 
home, he re are some thing s you may wi sh to co nsider:  
1. Ensu re that e ach me mber of your family has warm clothing an d waterp roof out er we ar.  
 
2. Take wate rproof footwea r for ea ch famil y member.  
 
3. Make sure ea ch family me mber h as at l east on e blan ket, rolled in plasti c sheeting or a 
plasti c shopping bag.  
 
4. Ensu re ea ch family member ha s identifi cation, e specially the young child ren. Name tags 
on clothi ng, wallet cards a nd wrist band s are all useful .  
 
5. Seal all perso nal do cume nts and family pape rs in pl astic.  
 
6. Take a supply of all essent ial medication s, esp ecially for those on p rescription d rugs, for 
each memb er of the family. You shoul d always  maintain a minimum two we ek supply of 
prescription drugs.  
 
7. Carry all items ne cessary for the care a nd feedin g of any infants in  the family, in cluding 
diape rs, feedi ng bottles a nd foods.  
   
  
 
 
May 20 07 - 14 -8. Bring ha nd to wels and toile try items for e ach person.  
 
9. Take a n AM tran sistor radio with extra b atteries a nd a flashlight wit h extra batteri es.  
 
10. Determine a l ocatio n to move to before leaving an d make sure ea ch family member 
knows where it is. Provide younge r chil dren wi th a n ote seal ed in pl astic stating the 
family's destination. This will reduce pr oblem s shoul d the family  be separated for any 
reason.  
As you leave your hom e remembe r to do the followin g:  
1. Lock all do ors and windows and d ouble che ck to ensure ga s and other heatin g fuel 
sources are t urned off, electri city is disconnected and the water i s shut off at the main 
valve leading to the house.  
 
2. Take extra care when driv ing. Familiar roads will appear  drasticall y different when 
covered by flood waters.  
 
3. Be on the loo kout for d amaged bri dges, slide s and wa shouts an d be particula rly alert for 
downed p ower line s.  
 
4. Be alert for e mergency person nel an d signs p rovidin g evacuatio n route dire ction s.  
 
5. Obey official s who are dire cting traffic o r involved in rescue o r flood control ope rations. 
They are the re to assi st you and to make sure the sit uation is h andled safely and 
effec tively.  
 
 
RETURNI NG HOME   
 
Do not retu rn home until e mergency operation s headquarte rs ann ounces the e mergency situation 
is over. Before returning m ake sure there is a safe water sup ply an d adeq uate sewa ge di sposal 
system in op eration. If you are in dou bt, conta ct the lo cal he alth uni t office.  
 
If your home is in an area served by a pu blic water supply it is quite possibl e safe drinking wate r 
will be available.  
 
For detail ed informatio n concerning the potential c ontamination of food stuffs contact your lo cal 
health unit. As a gen eral rule, avoid possible health  hazards by not eating food contaminate d by 
(submerged in) flood waters.  
 
Health offici als recommend dispo sal of the followi ng food stuffs:  
• NON-LIQ UID FOODS , including d ried fruits; ce reals; flour; sho rtenings; spices; p ackag ed 
good s; meats (fresh and cured);  
   
  
 
 
May 20 07 - 15 -• CANNED GO ODS  (if dam aged an d showing signs of see page);  
 
• BOTT LED F OOD P RODUCTS  (including home p reserves and home ca nned good s); 
bottled drin ks (potential for contami natio n to gather u nder the rippled edg e of the cap s); 
and  
 
• LEAFY VEGETABLES   
 
AUTOMOBILES, TRUCKS, FARM EQUIPMENT- DIESEL OR GAS   
 
If time allows,  move all vehicle s, recreational vehi cles, farm equipm ent and othe r modes of 
transpo rtation  with gasoline  or diesel eng ines to  high ground. Flood control hea dquarte rs and the 
local me dia will provide up -to-date info rmation co ncerning a nticipated flood crests. If the 
equipm ent ca n not be moved, then se al it as much as possible.  
 
Some co nsideration s include:  
1. Drain all oil and repl ace wi th SAE 30, M S or DG, run engine for approximately 10 to 15 
minutes.  
 
2. Remove spark plug s and place o ne or t wo table spoons of oil in ea ch cylin der; re-in stall 
the plug s.  
 
3. Remove the starte r, altern ator, ca rburetor, coil an d battery.  
 
4. Seal all openi ngs, in cluding distributo r, carbu rettor, oil  filter, air intake an d exhau st. Use 
polyethylene tied tightly where po ssible, wooden plu gs, rubb er plugs or tightly wa dded 
polyethylene.   
 
5. Transmissions are well sea led agai nst water, but se cure any breath er vents, filler tubing 
or air vent s with plugs.  
 
6. Cover exte rior of transmission with he avy gr ease. Clu tch plate s should be left re leased.  
 
7. Carry out as t horough a g rease job a s possible.  
 
 
 
 
   
  
 
 
May 20 07 - 16 -Once the wat ers have subsided the following procedure will reduce t he damage caused by water 
intake to the engin es:  
1. Start the engi ne as soon as possible after the wate rs have re ceded, and allow to  run for 
10 to 15 minu tes, or until n ormal o perating te mperature is rea ched. Drain the e ngine oil 
and replace the filter. Refill with SAE 30, MS  or DG. Start and run for another 10 to 15 
minutes to circulate oil to al l internal mov ing parts, drai n this oil, repl ace filter and refill 
once agai n.  
 
2. Remove a nd re-pa ck all sealed be arings.  
 
3. Coat all expo sed wear parts with a go od quality multipurpo se grease.  
 
4. Have vehi cle servi ced by a  reliable m echani c as soon as po ssible.

"Food and 
Water in an  
Emergency
If an earthquake, hurricane, winter storm, or other 
disaster strikes your community, you might not have 
access to food, water, and electricity for days or even 
weeks. By taking some time now to store emergency 
food and water supplies, you can provide for
your entire family.   Emergency Food Supplies
Even though it is unlikely that an emergency would cut off your 
food supply for two weeks, consider maintaining a supply that will 
last that long.  
You may not need to go out and buy foods to prepare an emergency 
food supply.  You can use the canned goods, dry mixes, and other 
staples on your cupboard shelves.  Be sure to check expiration dates 
and follow the practice of first-in, first-out.  
PREPARING  AN EMERGENCY  FOOD SUPPLY 
As you stock food, take into account your family’s unique needs 
and tastes. Familiar foods are important. They lift morale and give 
a feeling of security in times of stress. Try to include foods that they 
will enjoy and that are also high in calories and nutrition. Foods 
that require no refrigeration, water, special preparation, or cooking 
are best.  
2Individuals with special diets and allergies will need particular 
attention, as will babies, toddlers, and the elderly. Nursing mothers 
may need liquid formula, in case they are unable to nurse. Canned 
dietetic foods, juices, and soups may be helpful for ill or elderly 
people. 
Make sure you have a manual can opener and disposable utensils.  
Don’t forget nonperishable foods for your pets.
STORAGE  TIPS
  Keep food in a dry, cool spot—a dark area if possible.
  Open food boxes and other re-sealable containers carefully  
  so that you can close them tightly after each use.
  Wrap perishable foods, such as cookies and crackers, in  
  plastic bags and keep them in sealed containers.
  Empty open packages of sugar, dried fruits, and nuts into  
  screw-top jars or air-tight canisters for protection from pests.
  Inspect all food for signs of spoilage before use.
  Throw out canned goods that become swollen, dented, or  
  corroded. 
  Use foods before they go bad, and replace them with fresh  
  supplies, dated with ink or marker. Place new items at the  
  back of the storage area and older ones in front.
3SHELF-LIFE OF FOODS FOR STORAGE
The following provides some general guidelines for replacement of 
common emergency foods.
 Use within six months:
  Powdered milk - boxed
  Dried fruit
  Dry, crisp crackers 
  Potatoes
 Use within one year, or before the date indicated on the label:
  Canned condensed meat and vegetable soups
  Canned fruits, fruit juices, and vegetables
  Ready-to-eat cereals and uncooked instant cereals 
  Peanut butter
  Jelly
  Hard candy and canned nuts
  Vitamins
 May be stored indefinitely (in proper containers and conditions):
  Wheat
  Vegetable oils
  Dried corn
  Baking powder
  Soybeans
  Instant coffee, tea, and cocoa
  Salt
  Noncarbonated soft drinks
  White rice
  Bouillon products
  Dry pasta
  Powdered milk – in nitrogen-packed cans
4IF THE ELECTRICITY  GOES OFF...
FIRST...
Use perishable food from the refrigerator, pantry, garden, etc.
THEN...
Use the foods from the freezer. To limit the number of times you 
open the freezer door, post a list of freezer contents on it. In a 
well-filled, well-insulated freezer, foods will usually still have ice 
crystals in their centers (meaning foods are safe to eat) for at least 
two days.  Check to make sure the seal on your freezer door is still 
in good condition. 
FINALLY...
Begin to use non-perishable foods and staples.
5HOW TO COOK IF THE POWER GOES OUT
For emergency cooking indoors, you can use a fireplace. A charcoal 
grill or camp stove can be used outdoors. You can keep cooked 
food hot by using candle warmers, chafing dishes, and fondue pots. 
Use only approved devices for 
warming food. Canned food can 
be eaten right out of the can. If 
you heat it in the can, be sure 
to open the can and remove 
the label before heating. Always 
make sure to extinguish open 
flames before leaving the room.
WHEN FOOD SUPPLIES  ARE LOW
If activity is reduced, healthy people can survive on half their 
usual food intake for an extended period and without any food for 
many days. Food, unlike water, may be rationed safely, except for 
children and pregnant women. 
If your water supply is limited, don’t eat salty foods, since they 
will make you thirsty. Instead, eat salt-free crackers, whole grain 
cereals, and canned foods with high liquid content. 
NUTRITION  TIPS
During and after a disaster, it is vital that you maintain your 
strength. Remember the following:
 Eat at least one well-balanced meal each day.
 Drink enough liquid to enable your body to function properly  
  (two quarts or a half gallon per day).
 Take in enough calories to enable you to do any necessary work.
 Include vitamin, mineral, and protein supplements in your

6 Emergency Water Supplies
Having an ample supply of clean water is a top priority in an 
emergency. A normally active person needs to drink at least two 
quarts (half gallon) of water each day. People in hot environments, 
children, nursing mothers, and ill people will require even more.  
You will also need water for food preparation and hygiene. Store 
at least one gallon per person, per day. Consider storing at least a 
two-week supply of water for each member of your family.  If you 
are unable to store this quantity, store as much as you can.   
If supplies run low, never ration water. Drink the amount you need 
today, and try to find more for tomorrow. You can minimize the amount 
of water your body needs by reducing activity and staying cool.
7It is recommended to purchase food-grade water storage containers 
from surplus or camping supplies stores to use for water storage. 
If you decide to re-use storage containers, choose two-liter plastic 
soft drink bottles – not plastic jugs or cardboard containers that 
have had milk or fruit juice in them. The reason is that milk 
protein and fruit sugars cannot be adequately removed from these 
containers and provide an environment for bacterial growth when 
water is stored in them. Cardboard containers leak easily andPREPARE  AND STORE AN EMERGENCY  SUPPLY OF WATER
To prepare the safest and most reliable emergency supply of 
water, it is recommended that you purchase commercially bottled 
water.  Keep bottled water in its original container, and do not open 
it until you need to use it.
Store bottled water in the original sealed container, and observe the 
expiration or “use by” date.
If You Are Preparing Your Own Containers of Water...
8are not designed for long-term storage of liquids. Also, do not 
use glass containers, because they are heavy and may break.
  Thoroughly clean the bottles with dishwashing soap and  
  water, and rinse completely so there is no residual soap. 
  Additionally, for plastic soft drink bottles, sanitize the
  bottles by adding a solution of 1 teaspoon of non-scented  
  liquid household chlorine bleach to a quart (1/4 gallon) of  
  water.  Swish the sanitizing solution in the bottle so that it  
  touches all surfaces.  After sanitizing the bottle, thoroughly  
  rinse out the sanitizing solution with clean water.
  Fill the bottle to the top with regular tap water.  (If your   
  water utility company treats your tap water with chlorine,  
  you do not need to add anything else to the water to keep it  
  clean.)  If the water you are using comes from a well or   
  water source that is not treated with chlorine, add two drops  
  of non-scented liquid household chlorine bleach to each   
  gallon of water.
  Tightly close the container using the original cap.  Be
  careful not to contaminate the cap by touching the inside of  
  it with your fingers.  Write the date on the outside of the  
  container so that you know when you filled it. Store in a  
  cool, dark place. 
  Replace the water every six months if not using
  commercially bottled water.   Preparing Containers

9HIDDEN  WATER SOURCES  IN YOUR HOME
Safe water sources in your home include the water in your hot- 
water tank, pipes, and ice cubes. You should not use water from 
toilet flush tanks or bowls, radiators, waterbeds, or swimming 
pools/spas.   
You will need to protect the water sources already in your home 
from contamination if you hear reports of broken water or sewage 
lines, or if local officials advise you of a problem. To shut off 
incoming water, locate the main valve and turn it to the closed 
position. Be sure you and other family members know beforehand 
how to perform this important procedure.  
To use the water in your pipes, let air into the plumbing by turning 
on the faucet in your home at the highest level. A small amount of 
water will trickle out. Then obtain water from the lowest faucet in 
the home.
To use the water in your hot-water tank, be sure the electricity or 
gas is off, and open the drain at the bottom of the tank. Start the 
water flowing by turning off the water intake valve at the tank and 
turning on a hot-water faucet. Refill the tank before turning the gas 
or electricity back on. If the gas is turned off, a professional will be 
needed to turn it back on. 
EMERGENCY  OUTDOOR  WATER SOURCES
If you need to find water outside your home, you can use these sources. 
Be sure to treat the water according to the instructions on the next page 
before drinking it.
  Rainwater
  Streams, rivers, and other moving bodies of water
  Ponds and lakes
  Natural springs
Avoid water with floating material, an odor, or dark color. Use saltwater 
only if you distill it first. You should not drink flood water.
10WAYS TO TREAT WATER
The instructions below are for treating water of uncertain quality in 
rare emergency situations in the absence of instructions from local 
authorities when no other reliable clean water source is available 
and you have used all of your stored water. If you store enough 
water in advance, you will not need to treat water using these or 
other methods.
In addition to having a bad odor and taste, contaminated water can 
contain microorganisms (germs, bacteria, and viruses) that cause 
diseases such as dysentery, typhoid, and hepatitis. You should treat 
all water of uncertain quality before using it for drinking, food 
preparation, or hygiene.
There are many ways to treat water, though none are perfect. Often 
the best solution is a combination of methods. 
Boiling or chlorination will kill most microorganisms but will not 
remove other contaminants such as heavy metals, salts, and most 
other chemicals. Before treating, let any suspended particles settle 
to the bottom, or strain them through layers of paper towel, clean 
cloth, or coffee filter.
 Boiling  
Boiling is the safest method of treating water. In a large pot or kettle, 
bring water to a rolling boil for 1 full minute, keeping in mind that 
some water will evaporate. Let the water cool before drinking.
Boiled water will taste better if you put oxygen back into it by
pouring the water back and forth between two clean containers. This 
will also improve the taste of stored water.
 
You can use household liquid bleach to kill microorganisms. Use 
only regular household liquid bleach that contains 5.25 to 6.0 percent 
sodium hypochlorite. Do not use scented bleaches, colorsafe bleaches, or 
bleaches with added cleaners. Because the potency of bleach diminishes 
with time, use bleach from a newly opened or unopened bottle. Chlorination
11Add 16 drops (1/8 teaspoon) of bleach per gallon of water, stir and let 
stand for 30 minutes. The water should have a slight bleach odor. If it 
doesn’t, then repeat the dosage and let stand another 15 minutes. If it still 
does not smell of bleach, discard it and find another source of water.
Other chemicals, such as iodine or water treatment products (sold 
in camping or surplus stores) that do not contain 5.25 to 6.0 percent 
sodium hypochlorite as the only active ingredient, are not recom -
mended and should not be used.
While the two methods described above will kill most microorganisms 
in water, distillation will remove microorganisms that resist these 
methods, as well as heavy metals, salts, and most other chemicals.
Distillation involves boiling water and then collecting the vapor that 
condenses back to water. The condensed vapor will not include salt 
or most other impurities. To distill, fill a pot halfway with water. Tie 
a cup to the handle on the pot’s lid so that the cup will hang right-
side-up when the lid is upside-down (make sure the cup is not dan -
gling into the water), and boil the water for 20 minutes. The water 
that drips from the lid into the cup is distilled. (See illustration.)Distillation

Disaster Supplies Kit
In the event you need to evacuate at a moment’s notice and take 
essentials with you, you probably will not have the opportunity 
to shop or search for the supplies you and your family will need.  
Every household should assemble a disaster supplies kit and keep 
it up to date. 
A disaster supplies kit is a collection of basic items a family would 
probably need to stay safe and be more comfortable during and after 
a disaster.  Disaster supplies kit items should be stored in a portable 
container(s) near, or as close as possible to, the exit door.  Review 
the contents of your kit at least once per year or as your family 
needs change.  Also, consider having emergency supplies in each 
vehicle and at your place of employment.  
 The following should be included in your basic disaster supplies kit:  
  Three-day supply of nonperishable food and manual can   
  opener.
  Three-day supply of water (one gallon of water per person, per   
  day).
  Portable, battery-powered radio or television, and extra batteries.
  Flashlight and extra batteries.
  First aid kit and manual.
  Sanitation and hygiene items (hand sanitizer, moist towelettes,   
  and toilet paper).
  Matches in waterproof container.
  Whistle.
  Extra clothing and blankets.
  Kitchen accessories and cooking utensils.
  Photocopies of identification and credit cards.
  Cash and coins.
  Special needs items such as prescription medications, eye   
  glasses, contact lens solution, and hearing aid batteries.
  Items for infants, such as formula, diapers, bottles, and    
  pacifiers.
  Tools, pet supplies, a map of the local area, and other items to meet   
  your unique family needs.

    This Version  3.0 update of the Prudent Food Storage FAQ incl udes a
first time event.  An increasing number of people have bee n asking for a
printed and boun d copy of the FAQ,  apparently as a respons e to the Yea r
2000 computer problem and other Millenni al concerns.  With the aid of my
partner, Bob Hol lingsworth, we have formatted, printed and bound Version
3.0 to honor these requests.  Naturally, since we have spe nt a good deal
of our tim e and a not inconsiderable amount of our cash in doing  this we
are not giving it away  for free, but are  charging $15.00 (US) per copy
plus $3.00 shipping and hand ling (US Pos tal Service Priority Mail).  My
postal address may be found below and at the end of this file, or you
may e-mail me.
     This print edition will be availabl e for only for a limited  time.
The reason for this is that I am present ly at work on ""The  Prudent
Pantry:  Your Guide to Build ing A Food Insuran ce Program"", my first
commercial work.  When completed it will  contain all of the cont ent of
this FAQ plus a good deal more tha t I don't presentl y cover such as
storage program planning, inventor y control, storage  locations, the best
foods to store, grain mills & other equipment, water storage and

     This work is a compilat ion of answe rs to frequently asked questio ns
(FAQ) concerning long term food storage.   Its purpose is to prom ote an
understanding of the methods  and techniq ues used to extend the nutriti ve
and palatability shelf lives of those foods most sui table for use in
food storage programs.
     There  is commonal ity between food storage  and food preserva tion
even though they are not pre cisely the same thing.  Some of the
information here may be foun d in greater  or lesser detail in the
*rec.food.preserving* (r.f.p) FAQ compiled by Leslie Basel.  If you want
the how-to's of drying fruit, making jerky, canning beans, fermenting
pickles or corni ng beef, I refer you to her work and  the good stuff to
be found there.
     In this com pendium you will be take n through the ins and outs of
how to put away your storage  foods and have a reason able expecta tion of
getting somethin g edible back out of the container when you fina lly use
them.  Also covered will be food spoilag e -- how to recognize it and how
to combat it.  A resou rce list det ailing where to find sup plies and
further informat ion is inclu ded at the end.
     This file is upda ted as suffi cient material becomes availab le.  Be

     Is your foo d insurance up to date?
     Since  the entire idea of a food sto rage program  is that it should
be availab le for ""you and yours"" in time s of need, it is importa nt to
understand the conditi ons that can  affect the edibles stored in your
pantry.
     A sto rage program  is only as good as the quality of the foo d that
goes into it.  It cann ot get any better than what original ly went in,
but it can certainly get wor se.  In the fullness of time, all stored
foods will degrade in nutrient content and pal atability until they rea ch
the inevitable end whe re even the dog won't eat them .  It's because of
this eventuality that every article, book, and teacher concerned with
putting food by gives the same adv ice: *Date all foo d containers and
rotate, Rotate, ROTATE.  The first food in should be the first food
out.* This concept is often shortened to the acronym  FIFO.
     The reason for this emp hasis on stock rotation is that when
discussing the usefuln ess of foods tuffs there are really two she lf lives
to be cons idered.  The first is the nutr ient content  of the food .  This
actually begins to fade at the mom ent of harve st.  Three factors  dictate
nutritional shelf life:  The food's initial nutritio nal content;  the
processing and preserv ation steps it underwent; and its storage
conditions.  Eventually the nutrition will dwi ndle away to nothi ng.  At
some point you will have to decide whether the remaining nutriti on is
worth the space the food is taking up and if it shou ld be rotated out of
storage.
     The second shelf life is a food's palatab ility life or the point at
which undesirable changes occur to its taste, texture, color and cooking
qualities.  This is the reas on for the ""use by"" and ""sell by"" dates on
many foods and for she lve lives in gener al.  It will  almost always be in
excess of good nutriti ve life.  If you don't have anything  to replace it
with, it's not necessa ry to throw food out jus t because it's rea ched the
end of its best palatable storage life.  Do, however , keep in mind tha tadvancing age will onl y further decrease  the useful nutrition, increas e
the foods' unattractiveness and enlarge the chances that somethi ng may
cause the food to spoi l.
     Withi n reason, the key to prolonging the shelf life of your  edibles
lies in lowering  the tempera ture of the area they are stor ed in.  The
storage lives of most foods are cut in half by every  increase of 18 deg.
F (10 deg.  Celsius).  For example,  if you've stored your food in a
garage that has a temperature of 90 deg.  F, you shou ld expect a shelf
life less than half of what could be obtained at room temperature (70
deg. F) this in turn is less  than half the sto rage life that you  could
get if you kept them in your  refrigerator at 40 deg.  F.  Your storage
area should be located  where the tempera ture can be kept above freezin g
(32 deg. F) and,  if possible , below 72 deg. F.
     Ideal ly, your sto rage locatio n should have a humidity  level of 15%
or less, but unl ess you live  in the dese rt it's not terribly likely
you'll be able to achi eve this.  Regardl ess, moistur e is not goo d for
your stored edibles so you want to minim ize it as much as possible.
This can be done  by several methods.  The firs t is to keep  the area
air-conditioned and/or dehumidified during the humid times of the year .
The second is to use packagi ng impervious to moistur e and then to deal
with the moistur e trapped inside.  If you are able, there's no reason
not to use both.
     All contain ers should be kept  off the flo or and out of dire ct
contact from ext erior walls to reduce the chan ces of conde nsation.
     Anoth er major threat to your food is oxyg en.  Chances  are that if
you have it seal ed in moisture-proof containers then they are probably
air-tight as well.  This mea ns that the oxygen can also be kept from
doing its damage.  If no more can get in, your  only concern is the O2
that was trapped  in the cont ainer when it was sealed.  Lowering the
percentage of O2 to 2% or less of the atmosphe re trapped in the
packaging (called head gas) can greatly contribute to exte nding its
contents shelf life.  The three main tac tics for ach ieving this are
vacuum sealing, flushing with inert gas or chemically absorbing the
oxygen.  Any one  or a combin ation of the three can be used  to good
effect.
     Once you have tem perature, humidity  and oxygen under control, it is
then necessary to look  at light.  Light is a form of energ y and when it
shines on your stored foods long enough it transfers some of that energy
to the foo d.  This has  the effect of degrading its nutriti onal content
and appearance.  Fat soluble  vitamins, such as A, D and E are
particularly sensitive to light degradat ion.  It cer tainly is a pretty
sight to look at rows and rows of jars full of delic ious food,
particularly if you were the  one that put the food in thos e jars.
However, if you want to keep  them at their best, you'll admire them only
when you turn the ligh t on in the pantry to retrieve  one.  If you don' t
have a room that can be dedi cated to this purpose then sto re the jars in
the cardboard box they  came in.  This will pro tect them not only  from
light, but help to cushion them from sho cks which might break a jar or
cause it to lose  its seal.  For those of you in eart hquake country, it's
a particul arly good idea.  When ""terra"" is no longer ""firma"" your jars
just might dance right off onto the floo r.
     Assum ing they wer e properly process ed in the first place, canned,dried and frozen (never thawed) foods do not become unsafe when stored
longer than the recommended time, but their nutrient  quality fades and
their flavor goes downhill.  Following these rules of good  storage will
keep your food wholeso me and nutritious for as long as possible:
     #1 - First In, First Out (FIF O) means rotating your storage
     #2 - Cooler  is better
     #3 - Drier is better
     #4 - Less oxygen exposure means more shelf life.
     #5 - Don't shed light on your  food.
     Think  of rotating  your food storage  as paying your food ins urance
premiums -- slac king off on rotation cuts back on your cov erage.  Is
your food insurance up to date?

                     THE TEC HNIQUES OF FOOD STORAGE
=========================================================================
                                        
     In this sec tion will be cover ed a number of foods that are
particularly suited to being  included in stora ge programs along with the
various forms they can  be found in and specifi c tips for a numbe r of
different food categor ies.
A. GRAINS AND LEGUMES
     A.1 GRAIN VARIETI ES
     One of the most importa nt decisions in planning  a food storage
program is what kinds of grains to inclu de, but many  people do not giv e
this adequate thought.   Some just buy however much wheat or corn  or rice
they think is necessar y to meet their needs and leav e it at that .
Others rely on pre-pac kaged decisions made for  them by their storage
food retailer who put together a ""year's  supply of food"" to buy all at
once.  Either decision  could be a major mistake.
     There  are a numbe r of food storage plans one may use as a guide.
Many are based on the so-called ""Mormon Four"" of wheat, milk, honey and
salt, with as many add itional foods as the pla nner found to be
desirable.  When it was crea ted in 1937,  this plan may hav e been OK, but
we've learned a great deal since then.  An unf ortunate number of peopl e
in our soc iety develop  allergies to one kind of food  or another.   One of
the more common food allerge ns is wheat.  Even more unfortunate is the
fact that many people who have an allergy to wheat don't even know it.
They won't become aware of it unti l they try to live  with wheat as a
large part of their diet.  For thi s reason you should store what you eat
and eat what you  store, so that ugly sur prises such as this don't come
up when it's too  late to easily avoid them.
     A sec ond reason to thin k about storing a select ion of diffe rent
grains is appetite fatigue.  There are those who thi nk providing variety
in the die t is relativ ely unimport ant and that  if and when  the time
comes they'll eat what  they've got and that will be that.  For healthy ,
well-adjusted adults under ordinar y circumstances this mig ht be possible
without too much  difficulty.  However, the ent ire reason for hav ing a
food storage program is for when circums tances aren't ordinary.  Timesof crisis produce stress -- possib ly physical, but always mental.  If
you are suddenly  forced to eat a diet both ali en and monotonous, it is
going to add jus t that much more stress on top of what you  are already
dealing with.  If your  planning includes  the elderly , young children
and/or infants they might just qui t eating or refuse to eat suff icient
amounts and beco me unable to survi ve.  This is not a trivi al problem and
should be given serious consideration.  Consid er the positive aspects of
adding some comfort foods.
     In his book , *Making the Best  of Basics*,  James Stevens mentions a
post-WWII study by Dr. Norman Wright, of the British  Food Ministry,
which found that people in England  and Europe were more likely to reje ct
unfamiliar or distaste ful foods during times of stre ss than under normal
conditions.  When it's wheat, day in and day out, wheat's going to start
becoming distast eful fast. Far bet ter to have a variety of foods  on hand
to foresta ll appetite fatigue and, more importantly, to use thos e
storable foods in your  everyday diet so that you'll be accustomed to
them.
     [If anyone knows where I may find an actu al copy of the stu dy by
Dr. Wright, I'd appreciate it if you'd point me to it.  Thanks- ed.]
     ABOUT  GLUTEN:  As you read through the grains descrip tions below
you will come across frequen t mention of ""glut en"".  Gluten  is the
protein in grain s that enables the dough made from them to trap the
gasses produced by yeast fermentation or chemi cal reaction  of baking
powder or soda and in turn causes it to rise.  The amount of this protein
to be foun d in species  of grains and var ieties within a species can vary
radically.  Some grains such as rice hav e virtually no gluten at all and
will not produce  a raised loaf by itself while others like hard winter
wheat have a great deal and makes excellent raised bread.  Whether
gluten content is of importa nce to you will depend upon the end uses you
intend for your grain.
     Some of the common and relatively uncommo n types of grains and
their varieties are listed below.
    AMARAN TH: Amaranth  is not a true cer eal grain at all, but is a
              relative  of the pigw eeds and the  ornamental flowers we
call ""cockscomb"".  It's grown not only for its  seed, but for its  leaves
that can be cook ed and eaten as greens.  The seed is high in protein,
particularly the amino acid lysine which is limited in the true cereal
grains.  It can be milled as-is, or toas ted to provi de more flavor.  The
flour lacks gluten, so it's not suited for rai sed breads, but can be
made into any of a num ber of flat breads.  Some varieties can be poppe d
much like popcorn, or can be boile d and eaten as a cereal,  used in
soups, granolas, and the lik e.  Toasted or untoasted, it blends well
with other grain flours.
    BARLEY :   Barley is thou ght by some to be the first grain ever gro wn
              by man.  It has shor t, stubby kernels with a hull that is
difficult to remove.  Exclud ing barley intende d for malting or animal
feed, most of this gra in is consumed by humans in two form s.  Most
common is the white, highly processed ""pearl barley""  with much of its
bran and germ milled off alo ng with its hull.  It is the least
nutritious form of barley.  The second offerin g is called ""pot"" or""hulled barley"" and it has been subjecte d to the sam e milling process as
pearled, but wit h fewer trips through the poli sher.  Because of this, it
retains more of the nutritio us germ and bran.  Unless you are prepared
to try to get the hull s off I don't recommend buying unhulled barley.
Although it can be milled into flo ur, its low gluten content will not
make a good loaf of raised bread.  It can be combine d with other flours
that do have suf ficient gluten to make leavene d bread or used in flat
breads.  Barley flour and flakes have a light nutty flavor that is
enhanced by toas ting.  Whole barley is commonl y used to add thic kness to
soups and stews.
     Recen tly, a hull- less form has beco me available on the mark et
through a few supplier s.  This is whole grain barley with all of its
bran and germ intact and sho uld have the  most nutrients of any form of
this grain available.  I have not yet been abl e to discove r yet how
suitable it is for lon g term storage.
    BUCKWH EAT:     Buc kwheat is another of those seeds commonly considered
                   to be a grain, but which is not a true cereal.  It is
a close relative  to the dock s and sorrels.  The ""gra in"" itself is a
dark, three cornered seed resembli ng a tiny beechnut .  It has a hard,
fibrous hull req uiring a special buckwhe at huller to remov e it.  Here in
the U.S., it is most often used in panca kes, biscuit s and muffins.  In
Eastern Europe and Rus sia it is known in its toasted  form as ""kasha"".
In the Far  East, it's often made into ""soba"" or nood les.  It's also a
good bee plant, producing a dark, strongly flavored honey.  The flour is
light or dark dependin g on how muc h of the hul l has been removed  before
grinding.  Dark flour is much more strongly flavored  than lighter flour,
but because of the hig h fiber and tannin content of its hull it is not
necessarily more nutritious.  Buckwheat is one of those foods with no
middle ground in peopl es opinions -- they either love it or they  hate
it.  Like amaranth, it's hig h in lysine,  an amino acid com monly lacking
in the tru e cereal grains.
    CORN:     Corn is the most com mon grain crop in the U.S., but it is
   (maize)     mostly consume d indirectly as animal feed or even
              industri al feedstock rather than directly as food.   As one
of the ""Th ree Sisters""  (corn, squash and beans) it was the  staple grain
of nearly all of the indigen ous peoples of the American continen ts
before the advent of Europea n colonization.  It come s in an amaz ing
variety of forms  with some being better suited for a parti cular purpose
than others.  The vari eties intended to be eaten as fresh, green corn
are very high in sugar  content and do not dry or store well.  The othe r
varieties are the flin t, dent, flour, and popc orns.  All of them  keep
well when they have been pro perly dried.  To a certa in extent, they're
all interchangeable for purp oses of grin ding into meal (so metimes known
as polenta  meal) or flour (very finely ground corn, not cornstar ch), but
some make better meal than flour and vic e versa.
     As a genera l rule of thumb, the fli nt varieties make better meal as
they have a grittier texture  than the other corns.  If mea l, hominy and
hominy grits (commonly called just ""grits"") are what  you are mos t
interested in, use the  flint type.  If you int end to make corn masa for
tortillas and tamales,  then the flour type is what you wan t, but it is
seldom found on the commerci al market so the dent type is next best.
Popcorn is what you need if you want to pop it for snacks and it canalso be ground into meal or flour.  It seems to me it make s a very goo d
meal, but it's a bit gritty for flour.  It's also difficul t to hull it
with alkali treatment.  Your mileage may vary.  Yellow dent corn seems
to be the most commonl y available variety among storage food dea lers and
will work fine for alm ost any purp ose but popp ing.
     Popco rn is one form of a whole grain available to nearly everyone
in the U.S . if they know whe re to look.  It is so popular as a snack
food, particularly in movie theaters and events like fairs and ball
games, that even the smalles t of towns will generall y have at least one
business selling  it in twent y-five or fifty pound bags.  Since it's
meant to be eate n it's safe for food.  To be at its most ""poppab le"",
this corn needs to have a moisture  content between 13.5%-15.5% which
makes it just a little  too moist for ide al storage.  A small amount of
drying will need to be done before it's packed away.  If wanted for
popping later, it can always be re-hydra ted by sprin kling a tablespoon
of water per qua rt of kernels, shaking vigorou sly and allo wing it to be
absorbed for a day or two.  If you  still get too man y ""old maids"" or
unpopped kernels  then repeat the process  once more.  Popcorn is harder
than the other varieti es of corn so if your mill is not of the heavy
duty sort you may want  to consider  cracking the popc orn into coa rse
pieces first then grinding into finer textured  meal.
     Once you've decided between flint, dent or popc orn, (the flour
types are difficult to find commercially) you now have to decide upon
it's color:  There are yellow, white, blue, & red dried varietie s.  The
yellow and white types are the mos t common by far with the  blues and
reds mostly being relegated to curiosities, though blue corn has  been
gaining in popul arity these last few yea rs.  It shou ld be kept in mind
that white corn does not hav e the carotene (converts into vitamin A)
content of yello w corn.  Since vitamin A is one of the maj or limiting
vitamins in long  term food storage , any possible source of it should be
utilized.  For this reason I sugge st storing yellow rather than white
corn.  Additionally, much of the niacin content of corn is chemi cally
bound up in a form not  available for hum an nutrition unless it has bee n
treated with an alkali.  This is really of importance only if 85% or
more of your dai ly calorie intake will come from cor n, but grits, hominy
or corn masa (fo r tortillas and tamales)  are traditi onal uses for this
grain and can go a lon g way toward increasing the number of reci pes you
can make with it.  Giv e them a try, they're really quite good.
    MILLET :   Millet is an importa nt staple grain in North  China and
              India, but is little known as a food in the U.S, where we
mostly use it as bird feed.  The grain kernels  are very small, round,
and usually ivory colored or yello w, though some var ieties are darker.
The lack of glut en and a rather bland flavor may acc ount for the
anonymity of this grain but it has a more alkaline pH than  other grains
and makes it very easy to digest.  It also has  a higher iron con tent
than any other grain but ama ranth.  It swells a great deal when cooked
and supplies more servings per pou nd than any other grains.  When cooked
like rice it makes an excellent breakfas t cereal.  It has little gluten
of its own , but mixes well with other flours.
    OATS:     Though the Sco ts and the Irish have made an entire cuisine
              from oat s, it is still mostly thought of in the U.S. as a
bland breakfast food.  Seldom found as a whole  grain, it's usually soldprocessed in one form or another.  Much like barley,  oats are a
difficult grain to separate from their hulls.  Besides its longtime role
as a break fast food, oats make an excellent thickene r of soups and ste ws
and a filler in meat loafs and cas seroles.  Probably  the second most
common use for oats in Ameri ca is in cookies and gra nolas.  A little
creative thought  can really increase their culinary range.
     Liste d below in order of desi rability for storage are the forms of
oats found in this cou ntry.  Rolled and cut oats ret ain both the ir bran
and their germ.
     Oat groats:  These are whole oats with the  hulls removed.  They are
not often found in this form, but can sometime s be had fro m natural food
stores and some storage food dealers.  Oats are not the easiest thing to
get a consistent grind from so producing your own oat flou r takes a bit
of experie nce.
     Steel  cut oats:  Also known as Iris h, pinhead or porr idge (but so
are rolled) oats.  These are oat groats which have been cut into  chunks
with steel blades.  They're not rolled and loo k like coarse bits of
grain.  This for m can be found in both natural  food stores (sometimes
much cheaper) and many  supermarkets.
     Rolle d oats:  These are also commonly called old fash ioned, thick
cut or porridge oats.  To produce them, oat groats are ste amed and the n
rolled to flatten.  They can  generally be foun d wherever oats are sold .
They take slightly longer to cook than do the quick cooking oats, but
they retain more flavor, texture and nut rition.  This is what most
people will call to mind whe n they think of oatmeal.
     Quick  cooking rolled oats:  These are jus t steamed oat groa ts
rolled thinner than the old fashioned kind abo ve so that they will coo k
faster.  They can usua lly be found  right next to the thicker rolled
oats.
     Insta nt rolled oats:  These are the  ""just add hot wat er"" or
microwave type of oat cereals and are not part icularly suited for a
storage program.   They do, however , have uses in ""bug out"" and 72 hour
food kits for short term cri ses.
     Whole  oats:  This is with the  hulls still on.  They are sol d in
seed stores and sometimes straight  from the farmer who gre w them.
Unless you have some means of gett ing the hull s off, I don't recommend
buying oats in this form.  If you do buy from a seed supplier, make
certain that the y have not been treated with any che micals that are
toxic to humans.
    QUINOA :   Quinoa is yet another of the gra ins that is not a true
              cereal.  It's botanical name is Chenopodium quinoa
(pronounced ""keen-wah""), and is a relati ve of the common weed
Lambsquarter.  The ind ividual kernels are abou t 1.5-2 mm in size  and are
shaped rather like sma ll flattened spheres.  When quinoa is cook ed, the
germ of the grai n coils into a small ""tail"" that len ds a pleasan t
crunch.  This exotic grain should be thoroughly washed before cooking in
order to prevent  it from tas ting bitter.   There are several varieties of
quinoa that have color ranging from near white to a dark brown.  The
larger white varieties are conside red superior  and are the  most common.    RICE:     Rice is the most com monly consumed food grain in the
              world.  The U.S. is the leading exporter of it, though we
actually only produce about 1% of the global supply.   The majority of
the world's rice is eaten within five miles of where  it was grow n.
     Much like wheat and cor n, rice comes in a numbe r of varieti es, each
with different charact eristics.  They are typi cally divided into classes
by the len gth of their  kernel grains; short, medium and long.
     Short  grain rice:  The short grain variety is a littl e softer and
bit moister when it cooks and tend s to stick togethe r more than the
longer rices.  It has a sweeter, somewha t stronger flavor than long
grain rice.
     Mediu m grain rice:  The medium grain variety is not very common in
the States.  It has flavor like the shor t variety, but wit h a texture
more like long.
     Long grain rice:  The long grain variety cooks up into a drier,
flakier dish tha n the shorter types and the flavor tends to be blander .
It is the most commonl y found size of rice on American grocery shelves .
     Each of the above may be proc essed into brown, white, parboiled or
converted and instant rice.  Below is a short discussion of the
differences between the vari ous types.
     Brown  rice:  This is whole grain rice wit h only the hull removed.
It retains  all of the nutrition and has a pleasant nutty flavor.   From a
nutritional standpoint it is by far the best, but it has one fla w:  The
essential oil in the germ is very susceptible to oxidation and soon goes
rancid.  As a result, brown rice has a shelf life of only about six
months from the date of purc hase unless given special packaging or
storage.  Freezi ng or refrigeration will greatly extend this.  It's
possible to purc hase brown rice from lon g term food suppliers already
specially packaged in air tight containe rs with an inert nitroge n
atmosphere or you can do it yourself.  In this  kind of packaging, (if
properly done), the storage life can be extended for several years.
    Conver ted rice:  Convert ed rice starts as whole rice still in the
hull which undergoes a proce ss of soaking and steaming until it is
partially cooked.  It is dried, hulled and the n polished to remo ve the
bran and germ.  The steaming  process drives some of the vitamins  and
minerals from the oute r layers into the white inner layers.  This makes
it more nutritio us than polished white rice, but als o makes it more
expensive.  Its storage life is the same  as regular white rice.
     White  rice:  This is raw rice  that has had its outer layers milled
off, taking with it about 10% of its pro tein, 85% of its fat and  70% of
its mineral content.  Becaus e so much of the nutriti on is lost, white
rice sold in the U.S. has to be ""enriche d"" with vitamins to part ially
replace what was  removed.
     Insta nt rice: The type of rice is fully cooked and then deh ydrated
needing nothing more than the addi tion of wate r to reconst itute it.  In
a pinch, it's not even  necessary to use hot water.  It's notparticularly suitable for inclusio n in storage  programs, but it does
have a place in ""seventy-two hour"" and other short-term emergenc y kits.
The white variety is by far the most com mon, but in the last few  years
instant brown rice has  made an appearance on the mar ket.
    RYE: Rye is well known as a bread grain in the U.S.  It has dark
         brown kernels  longer and thinner than wheat, but less gluten.
Bread made from this grain tends to be somewha t dense unless gluten is
added (often in the form of a lot of wheat flour) with col or that ranges
from pale to dark brown.  German pumpern ickel, made with unrefin ed rye
flour and molasses, is the darkest , densest form.
    SORGHU M:  Sorghum is probably more widely known here in the States
              for the syrup made from it.  Als o known as ""milo"",  it is
one of the principle cereal grains grown of Africa.  Its seeds are
somewhat round, a little smaller than pepperco rns, of an overall  brown
color with a bit of red and yellow mixed in.  The varietie s called
""yellow endosper m sorghum"" are con sidered to have a better  taste.  It is
a major feed gra in in the Southwes tern U.S. and is where the vas t
majority of the national production goes.  Like most of the othe r
grains, sorghum is low in gluten, but the seed s can be milled into flo ur
and mixed with higher gluten flours or made into fla t breads, pancakes
or cookies .  In the Far East , it is cook ed and eaten like rice, while in
Africa it is ground into mea l for porridge.  It's also fer mented for
alcoholic beverages.
    TRITIC ALE:     Tri ticale is not a creation  sprung from the
                   smo oth brows of *Star  Trek* script writers.  It is,
in fact, a cross  or hybrid between  wheat and rye.  This youngest  of
grains combines the producti vity of whea t with the ruggedn ess of rye and
has a high nutrition value.  The kernels  are gray-brown, oval shaped
larger-than-wheat and plumper than rye.  It can be used in much the same
way as either of its two par ents.  It will mak e a raised bread like
wheat does, but the gluten is a bit weak  so wheat flour is frequ ently
added to strengt hen it.  Bec ause of the delicate nature of its gluten,
excessive kneading must be avoided .  Although it is the youngest  of the
grains, it's bee n around for decades, but has curiously never achieved
much popularity.  Whether this is for reasons of agricultural producti on
or public acceptance I don't  know.
    WHEAT:     Wheat comes in a num ber of diffe rent varieti es.  Each
              variety is more suitable for som e purposes based on its
characteristics.  The most common classifications for its varieties are
spring or winter, hard or soft, red or white.
     The hard wheats have kernels that tend to be small, very hard and
with high gluten contents.  Low gluten wheat does not prod uce as fine a
loaf as high glu ten wheat, though it can still be used for  yeast breads
if necessa ry.  As a general rule, hard varieti es have more protein than
soft varieties.
     The soft wheats have kernels tending to be larg er, plumper and
softer in texture than hard wheats.  Their gluten content is less and
are used in bisc uits, pastries, quick breads, pastas, and breakfastcereals where a higher  gluten content would contribu te an undesirable
tougher texture.
     Winte r wheats are planted in the fall, over win ter in the field and
are harvested the next  summer.  Spring wheats are planted in the early
spring and are harvest ed in the fall.  Red whe ats comprise  most of the
hard varieties while white wheats comprise most of the sof t.  Recently ,
hard white wheats have been developed that are  very suitable for raised
bread making.  Some feel the  hard white varieties make a better tasting
whole wheat bread than the hard red.
     The hard red vari eties, either spring or winter, are the most
commonly stored because of their high protein and should have no less
than 12%.  The hard white spring wheats are still relative ly new and are
not yet as wides pread.  They have the same exc ellent storage

     A.2 LEGUME VARIETIES
     Unles s you are willing to spend a great deal of money  on preserve d
meats, a food storage program not including a large quantity of legumes
is simply incomplete.  There are few non - animal foods that contain the
amount of protein to be foun d in dried beans, peas, and lentils.   The
varieties commonly available in this cou ntry have protein contents
ranging from 20% -35%.  As with mos t non-animal proteins, they are not
complete in them selves for purpose s of human nutriti on, but beco me so
when they are combined  with the incomple te proteins found in grains.  It
is for thi s reason that grains and legumes are so often mentione d
together.  In cultures  all over the worl d, it is common to find the two
served together at a meal, making a complete protein , even when those
doing the serving have no scientif ic understanding of nutr ition at all.
     The legume family, of which all bea ns, peas, lentils,  and peanuts
are a part, is one of the largest in the plant kingdom.  Because  of this
and the many tho usands of years of devel opment and cultiva tion that man
has given them, the variety of edible legumes available to us is huge.
Both the appeara nce and the names of these varieties are colorfu l and
varied.  They range from ""ad zuki beans"",  a type of soybean  from the
Orient, to ""zipp er peas"", a common ly found field-pea here in the
Southern U.S.  Their color can ran ge from a clean white, to deep  red,
dull green to flat bla ck with thousands of mixtures and patterns  of
colors.
     In spite of this incredible variety  of names and colo rs, legumes
are largely interchangeable in cooking usage, although some dishes just
wouldn't be the same if a differen t type were used.  Below is a partia l
list of some of the more com monly eaten bean varieti es here in the U.S .
    BLACK BEAN:    Also known as ""turtle  beans"", these small, dark
                   bro wnish-black, oval-shaped beans are well known in
Cuban black bean soup.  They are very commonly  used in Central and Sou th
America and in China.  They tend to blee d very darkly when cooked so
they are not wel l suited to being combined with other beans, lest they
give the entire pot a muddy appearance.    BLACK- EYED PEA:     Alth ough there is trem endous variation among the
                        many  varieties of fiel d-peas eaten throughout
the Southern United States, it is black-eyed peas that are  the most
commonly known nationw ide.  The coloring  of field-peas is as varied as
the rest of the legume family, with black-eyed peas being small, oval-
shaped with an overall  creamy color and, of course, their distinctive
black-eye.  Dried field-peas cook very quickly  and combine  very tastily
with either rice or cornbrea d.
    CHICKP EA: Also kno wn as the ""garbanz o bean"" or ""cecci pea"" (or
              bean), it tend s to be a creamy or tan color, rather
lumpily roundish  and larger than dried garden peas.  Many have eaten
chickpeas, even if they've never seen a whole one.  They are the  prime
ingredient in hummus and fal afel and are  one of the oldest cultivated
legume species known, going back as far as 5400 B.C. in the Near  East.
    KIDNEY  BEANS:  Just like the rest of the family,  kidney beans can be
                   fou nd in wide variety .  They come in both a light and
dark red color in thei r distinctive kidney shape.  Probabl y best known
here in the U.S.  for their use in chili, they figure prominently in
Mexican, Brazili an and Chinese cuisine.
    LENTIL S:  Lentils are an odd lot.  They don't fit in with either the
              beans or the peas and occu py a place by them selves.  Their
shape is differe nt from the other legumes being roundish little discs
with colors ranging from mud dy brown, to green  to a rather  bright
orangish-red.  They cook ver y quickly compared  to the larg er beans and
have a distinctive flavor.  They are muc h used in Far East ern cuisine
from Indian to Chinese .
    LIMA BEANS:    In the Southern  U.S., they are also com monly called
                   ""bu tter beans"".  They are one of the mos t common
legumes found in this country in all man ner of prese rvation from the
young small beans to the lar ge fully mature type.  Their flavor is
pleasant, but a little  bland.  Their shape is rather flat and broad with
colors ranging from pale gre en to speckled cream and purple.
    PEANUT S:  The pean ut, commonly  known outside the U.S. as the
              ""groundn ut"", is not actually a nut at all, but a legume.
They are another  odd species  not much like the  more familiar beans and
peas.  Whatever their classification peanuts are cer tainly not
unfamiliar to U.S. eat ers.  Peanut s have a high protein percenta ge and
even more fat.  They are one  of the two legume species commonly grown
for oilseed in this country,  and are als o used for peanut butter, and
boiled or roasted peanuts.  Many Central  and South America n, African and
Chinese dishes incorpo rate peanuts  so they are  useful for much more than
just a snack food or cooking  oil.
    PINTO BEANS:   Anyone who has eaten Tex-Mex food  has probabl y had
                   the  pinto bean.  It is one of the most commonly eaten
beans in the U.S ., particularly in the Southwe stern portion of thecountry.  Stereo typically bean sha ped, it has a dappled pattern of tans
and browns on its shel l.  Pintos have a flavor  that blends well with
many foods.  When ground together with white or navy  beans they make my
favorite home-made ver sion of fala fel.
    SOYBEA NS: An entir e university could be founded on the culinary and
              industri al uses of the soy bean.  It is by far the legume
with the highest  protein content in comm ercial production as well as
being the other legume oilseed alongside the peanut.   The beans
themselves are small, and round with a multitu de of different shades.
Because of their  high oil content,  they are more sen sitive to oxygen
exposure than other legumes and precauti ons should be take n accordingly
if they are to be kept  for more than a year in stora ge.  Althoug h the
U.S. grows a very large percentage of the glob al supply, we cons ume
virtually none of them  directly.  Most of them  go into cat tle feed, are
used by industry  or exported .  What does get eaten directl y has usually
been processed in some  fashion.  Soybean  products range from tof u, to
tempeh, to textu red vegetabl e protein (TVP) and hund reds of othe r uses.
They don't lend themselves well to just being boiled until done and
eaten the way other beans and peas  do.  For this rea son, if you plan on
keeping some as a part of your sto rage program  (and you should) you
would be well served to begi n to learn how to process and prepare them
now when you're not under pressure  to produce.   That way you can  throw
out your mistake s and order pizza, rather than having to choke them
down, regardless.
                                                      
     A.3  TYPES OF AVAILABILITY OF GRAIN S AND LEGUMES
                                                      
     Grain s and legumes of all typ es may be purchase d in a numbe r of
different fashions depending largely on where you live and  what time of
year it is.  The  following will cover the vari ous steps in the
processing chain where they might be found starting with the for ms most
immediately suitable for sto rage and pro gressing all the way bac k to the
farmer.
     Each type of avai lability has its good and bad points.  As you
might expect, the more  processing the product receives, the high er its
price is likely to be.  The further back along the process ing chain you
go the che aper the pro duct should become in terms of purch ase price.  It
will, however, cost you more  in time and  effort to get it into a
condition ready to put it into sto rage.
     The easiest  and simples t way to incorporate grains and legu mes into
your storage program is to purchas e your items ""pre-cleaned and
pre-packaged"".  This is grai n or legumes  that have been harveste d,
cleaned and put up in bags or othe r containers-possibly even goi ng so
far as to already be package d for long-term storage.   If you don 't live
in the are a where they are grown, it is probably your only option.
     If you want  to purchase  in bulk the n you may be able to find
""pre-cleaned"" which means that it has been pas sed through fans, screens
or sieves to remove chaff, smut balls, insect parts, mouse droppings and
other debris.  It prob ably won't be in any for m of packagi ng and you may
have to provide your own con tainer.  There may be minimum purchase
amounts as well.   If the moi sture content is in the right range then
nothing will nee d to be done  other than to put it up in your own  storagepackaging.  Be certain  to make sur e it is inte nded for hum an food use,
otherwise read the cau tionary text below.
     Shoul d you happen to live in the area whe re the type of grain or
legume that you are interest ed in purchasing is grow n you may be able to
purchase direct from the pro ducer or distributor.
     If you are interested in doin g this, it may be possible to find
your product ""field-run"" whi ch means that it's been harvested and sold
shortly thereaft er.  It will  not have been giv en any cleaning or
processing and is like ly to be rather dirty dependin g upon the
conditions under which it was grow n and harvested.
     A sec ond form cal led ""field-run from storage"" is prod uct that has
been harvested and the n put into storage  for a time.   It will have all
of the dir t and detritus of field run grain and what ever it may have
picked up from the sil o as well.
    IMPORT ANT NOTE:     If you hav e purchased your grains and legumes
                        from  a foods dealer then you  needn't worry about
hidden mold infections, fungicides or insectic ides that are unsa fe for
human consumption.  In the U.S., the pro ducts will have been che cked
several times by Feder al and State agriculture departments and probabl y
by the maj or foods dealers as well , to ensure its quality.
     This is not necessarily the case when you  purchase your gra ins or
legumes directly  from the farmer or elev ator operato r as field-run or
field-run from storage  grain.  Nor is it neces sarily the case if you'v e
made the decisio n to utilize  grains marketed as anim al feed.  Inspecti on
procedures vary from nation to nation, so if you buy  outside of the U.S.
inquire of your supplier.
     If you are buying your grains and legumes  from some place other
than a foods dealer, you nee d to know the hist ory of what you are
buying.  There is the remote possibility that field-run from sto rage or
any grade of grain not specifically sold for human consump tion may hav e
had fumigants, fungici des or insec ticides not certified as safe for
human foods added while it was in the bin.  It is importan t to know what
it has bee n treated with bef ore you buy it.
     Strai ght field-run grai n, other than being dirty, is not likely to
have had anythin g added to it that  would make it undesirable for human
consumption.  There is, howe ver, the als o remote possibility it may have
been infected with fun gi that would make it unsafe for eat ing.
     One of thes e fungal infections of grain is call ed ""ergot"".  This
fungal disease affects  the floweri ng parts of some members  of the gras s
family, mostly confine d to rye.  Consumi ng the fungus causes a nervous
disorder known as St. Anthony's Fire.  When eaten in large  quantities
the ergot alkaloids may caus e constriction of the blood vessels,
particularly in the extremit ies.  The effects of ergot poisoning are
cumulative and lead to numbn ess of the limbs and oth er, frequent ly
serious, symptom s.
     The fungus bodies are hard, spur like, purple-black structu res that
replace the kern el in the grain head.  The erg ot bodies can vary  in size
from the length of the kernel to as much  as several times as long.  They
don't crush as easily as smut bodies of other funguses.  When they arecracked open, the inne r broken faces can be off-whit e, yellow, or tan.
The infected grain looks very different from ordinar y, healthy rye
grains and can be spot ted easily.  Ergot only rarely affects other
grains and will generally afflict rye only whe n the growing conditions
were damp.  If you pur chase field run rye, you  should closely examine it
first for the presence  of ergot bodies.  If you find  more than a very
few, pass up that grain and look elsewhe re.
     Ergot  is typicall y not a common problem in the U.S and is easily
spotted when it does occur.  Other grain fungi, however, are muc h harder
to spot and also  have serious consequences should they be consumed.  The
various species of ""Aspergillus"" and ""Fu sarium"" molds can be a problem
almost anywhere and should be kept  in mind. *Please see Section III.B
Molds In Grains and Legumes for more inf ormation concerning this.*
     Somet imes grain in the form of anim al feed or seed grain/le gumes is
available.  Keep in mind ani mal feeds may have  a higher contamin ant
level than what is permissible for human consumption.  Under certain
circumstances, the USD A allows the sale of grain or legumes for animal
feed that could not be sold for direct human food use.  It may even be
mixed varieties of one grain and not all  one type.  Seed grains,  in
particular, must be investig ated careful ly to find out wha t they may
have been treated with.  It is quite common for seed  to have had
fungicides applied to them, and possibly  other chemicals as well .  Once
treated, they are no longer safe for hum an or animal consumption.
     If you do purchas e field-run grain of any sort, examine it closely
for contamination and moldy grain.  Ask the farmer or dist ributor
whether it has been tested for mol d or ""mycoto xin"" (fungal  toxin)
content.  This is espe cially the case if you are buy ing field-run CORN ,
RYE, SOYBEANS or RICE.   When you purchas e direct from the field, you
may be getting it befo re it has been che cked.  Be certain of what it is
that you are get ting and ask  questions if you choose to go this route.
Know who you are  dealing with.  Unless you jus t can't find any other
source, I don't recommend using animal feed or seed grains for human
food.
    *Pleas e see section III.B.3 "" Molds In Grains and Legu mes"" for
further informat ion.*
     A.3.1  MOISTURE CONTENT
     The moistur e content of the grain or legu me you want to put by has
a major impact on how long you wil l be able to keep it in storage and
still remain nutritious and edible.  Some of the ava ilable literature
states that grain with a moisture content as high as 13% can be safely
put up, but ther e is a risk to keeping it at that moisture  level that
should be understood.
     The outside  of every kernel of grai n and bean you buy  or grow hos ts
thousands of fungi spores and bact eria.  This is all perfectly natural
and is not a reason for alar m.  The prob lem lies in that at mois ture
levels between 13.5% to 15% some fungal species are able to grow  and
reproduce.  Aerobic bacteria  (needing free oxy gen to survi ve) require
moisture in the 20% range.  If you  have grain with a moist ure content as
high as 13% you are perilous ly close to having enough moisture to enab le
mold growth which could lead to the spoi lage and los s of your product.For this reason,  I suggest you kee p all grains and legumes  to a moistu re
content of no more tha n 10%.  An excepti on to this is raw peanuts which
are particularly susceptible to an Asper gillus mold growth that produces
aflatoxin (a type of mycotox in) and shou ld be stored with an 8% moisture
content or less.
     If you do not hav e a clue as to what the moisture level of your
grain is here are seve ral methods to determine it.  The first method
requires a great  deal more oven time, but is the sim plest and has less
room for error to cree p in.  The second method is much qui cker, but
greater care mus t be taken to prev ent mistakes .
     Highl y precise moisture  content measurements generall y require
equipment and faciliti es beyond the scop e of what can be had by the
average person.  It is still  possible though to make  some determinations
that will be of real use for  our purpose s.
     You'l l need some way to measu re weight with a fair degree of
accuracy.  The better the scale you use,  the more reliabil ity you'll
have in your det erminations.  Provided that it will weigh accurately to
the half-ounce or less , any scale that can be calibrated with a known
check weight will do.  Even postal scales can be made to serve if they
are carefully calibrat ed against a known  weight.  Many ind ividuals
interested in starting  storage programs may have gra in weight scales
used in ammuniti on reloading that might serve well.
     Also necessary is a the rmometer capable of with standing and
accurately measuring oven temperat ures.  As many bak ers can tell  you,
home oven thermostats are often notoriou sly inaccura te so it is better
to rely on a dec ent thermome ter.  Most kitchen  supply stores can supply
one that is oven  safe and will acc urately measure to the degree
Fahrenheit or Celsius.
     Prope r technique calls for preheati ng the oven for a half-hour or
more before starting the deh ydrating process so that  it will be of a
uniform heat thr oughout.  The samp le pan should be placed on the middle
rack as close to the vertica l and horizontal center of the oven as
possible.  The bulb or dial of the thermometer should be placed next to
the pan.
     METHO D ONE.
     This method is for meas uring moisture content in whol e grains and
legumes.  Grain flours or meals, milk powders and any othe r finely
textured foods should use method two det ailed below.
     To be done prior to measuring -- choose a shall ow heat resistant
container that has a close fitting  lid.  Clean it thorough ly and dry it
completely in your ove n for 10-15 minutes.  Allow it to cool and  then
weigh it careful ly.  This will giv e you the tare wei ght or what your
container weighs empty.
     Depen ding on how your scale is cali brated you can use  a smaller
sample size than what is indicated below.  Using the twenty-ounce sample
mentioned in the following text will all ow for fairly accurate reading s
with the average  postal scale.  A scale that will measure to the gram
could use as small a sample as 20 grams.  A powder scale could use eve nless, but the smaller your sample size becomes  the more finicky care you
must take not to allow  error to creep in.  Kee p your sample size large
enough to easily work with.
     Allow ing for the weight of the samp le pan, measure out a weighed
twenty-ounce representative sample of the grai n or legumes  in question .
Ideally, you sho uld mix the entire lot thoroug hly immediat ely before
removing the sam ple, but if this is not possible then take it from the
middle center of the contain er.  It is importa nt that you use care in
this measurement since it will aff ect all foll owing determinations.
     Put the sam ple in the contain er making sure it is not more than an
inch deep.  Place it in the oven with the lid off and allo w to heat.
Below is a table  giving the oven tempera tures and times per grai n or
legume type:

    ------------------------------------------------------
                  Oven  Temperature      Oven Time
        Seed      Deg.   F    C            Hour s
    Barley              266  130            20
    Beans              217  103            72
    Corn               217  103            72
    Oats               266  130            22
    Rye                266  130            16
    Sorghu m, millet    266  130            18
    Soybea ns, peanuts  217  103            72
    Wheat,  rice        266  130            19
          When the deh ydration period is over place the close fitting
lid on the sample pan and allow to cool in the oven with the doo r
closed.  Remove the pan and carefully weigh it.
     A one  ounce loss in weight indicate s your grain has a rough ly five
percent moisture  content, 2 ounces  indicates that it has a 10% moistur e
content, etc., etc.  You mig ht even be able to cut it as fine as a hal f
oz loss, but I wouldn' t try to take it further  than that.
     Obvio usly, this is only  a rough measure, but it works  and can be
done with postal or dietetic  scales that are availab le virtually
everywhere.  As I mentioned above, if you have  a scale with a finer
calibration it is poss ible to use a smaller sample size and achi eve the
same result.
     If anyone has a better way of measu ring moistur e levels which can
be done without a lab or special equipme nt I'd surely like to hear it.
                      
     METHO D TWO
     This method is much fas ter to use than the firs t, but greater care
must be taken to preve nt error.  It can be used to determi ne moisturecontents of whol e grains and legumes, flours, meals and various food
powders.
     The same equipmen t as was use d in Method One will be required here
as well as a low -RPM grain mill or some other device that can reduce a
quantity of the grain to a meal consiste ncy with onl y minimal heating of
the sample.  If the food to be tested is alrea dy at a meal consistency
or finer then it can be used  as-is.
     Grind  a quantity of product you wan t to measure  the moistur e
content of.  Tak e care to grind the samp le slowly enough to keep
friction heat build up to a minimu m or else moisture  will be lost due to
heat evaporation before it can be weighed.
     Immed iately upon finishing the grin ding, weigh out your sam ple so
as to mini mize unmeasu red moisture  loss.
     Place  the sample in the oven and dehydrat e in the man ner used in
Method One for a perio d of two hou rs at a temperature setting of 275
deg. F (135 deg. C).  When the hea ting period is finished cover with the
tight-fitting lid and allow to cool in the ove n.  Remove and wei gh
carefully.  Moisture determi nation is the same  as above.
     A.3.2   CLEANING IT YOUR SELF
     If you've chosen to purchase field-run grain or if the pre- cleaned
product you've bought isn't clean enough, you can do it yourself .
     The fastest  and easiest  method is ""fannin g"", a form of winn owing.
This is done by pouring the grain slowly through the air stream of a fan
or blower into a clean , deep container such as a car dboard box or tras h
can.  The wind blowing  through the falling grain will blow out most of
the broken kernels, chaff, smut balls, mouse droppin gs, etc.  If you'r e
losing too much good grain, try turning the fan down  or moving it
further back fro m the container.  The deep con tainer will cut down on
the amount of kernels that bounce out.  Repeat  fanning as necessary
until the grain is clean enough to suit or you've blown all of the
lighter contamin ants out.
     If the fann ing didn't get the  grain clean enough it can be
further cleaned by running it thro ugh a screen  or sieve.  This
should be made with holes just big  enough to pass an avera ge sized
grain of what it is you're cleanin g.  Obviousl y, the size of the
holes will necessarily vary depending upon the  kernel size of the
grain.
     Shoul d the kernels still not be clean enough to suit then you'll
just have to resort to hand picking out the offendin g particles.  I'd
strongly suggest  doing this just prior to grin ding where it can be done
in small batches  rather than trying to do your  entire storage all at
once.  It's much easier to do a few poun ds at a time than fifty or a
hundred.
     If you have  it in mind to wash the grain, this should not be done
prior to storage , but, rather, just before use.  After it's been rinsed,
it should be dried immediately in the oven by placing it no deep er than
1/2 inch and hea ted at 150 deg. F for an hour.   It should be stirredoccasionally to improve drying.

B. DRY MIL KS
     Got milk?  In the  refrigerator, right?  Milk is a gre at source of
essential amino acids and vital calcium,  but in its fresh liquid form it
is a highl y perishable commodity.  Fortunately, milk can be foun d in
several forms that len d themselves to food sto rage.  The various  types
of dry mil ks are the best suited to the task.
     B.1  TYPES OF DRY MILKS
    NONFAT :   This is pasteurized skim milk reduced to a powdere d
              concentr ate.  It can  be found in two forms, regular and
instant.  They are bot h made from milk in a spray-drying process , but
the instant variety has been  given further processing to make it more
easily soluble in wate r than regular dry milk.  Both types have the same
nutrient composi tion.  The regular  variety is more compact  and require s
less storage space than the instantized variety, but it is more
difficult to reconstitute.  The most eas ily found variety is the
instant, availab le in nearly any grocery  store.  The regular variety has
to be soug ht out from baking and restaur ant supplier s and storage food
dealers.
     It takes 3.2 oz or abou t 3 tablespo ons of insta nt nonfat dry milk
added to 8 oz of water  to make 1 cup of milk you can  drink or cook wit h
just like fresh milk, albeit with a considerable flavor differen ce.
Combining the dry milk  with water at least several hours before you plan
to use it gives it time to dissolv e fully and to develop a fresh er
flavor.  Shaking  the fluid milk vigorous ly will incorporate air and will
also help to improve flavor.   Add the powder to bake d goods, gravies,
smoothies, hot cereals , casseroles and meat loaf as a nutrition booster.
It can als o be used to make yogurt, cheese and most any cultured  dairy
product that doe s not require a high fat  content.
    FLAVOR ED NONFAT:    This  may be foun d packaged in a variety of forms
                        from  a low calorie diet drink (artificially
sweetened) to the othe r end of the scale, as cocoa mix or malted milk.
The key ingredie nt is the dry milk  so buy and store these products
accordingly.    WHOLE MILK:    This is whole dry mil k with all of its fat content
                   and  therefore has a shorter  shelf life than nonfat.
Other than that, it can be used in exact ly the same way.  Dry whole milk
is difficu lt to find, but can some times be found where camping and
outback supplies  are sold.
    BUTTER MILK:    Dry buttermilk is for use in reci pes calling for
                   but termilk.  Since it has a sligh tly higher fat
content than non fat dry milk , it general ly does not keep as long .
     B.1.1   BUYING DRY MILK PRODUCTS
    (a)- Be sure  the dry mil k you are buying has bee n fortified with
vitamins A and D.  All  of the nonf at dry milks I've seen come fortifie d
with these two vitamin s.  The dry buttermilk does not come  this way, at
least the SACO brand does not.  I don't know if the flavored mixes and
the dry whole milk do or not.
    (b)- There should be no artificial colors or flavors.  I believe it
is illegal  to add pres ervatives to any dry mil k sold in the U.S.  so a
claim of ""no pre servatives"" on the label is of no conseque nce.  Other
nations may be differe nt, however.
    (c)- ""Extra Grade"" on the labe l indicates the manufact urer has hel d
to higher processing and qua lity standar ds and the milk is somew hat
lower in fat, moisture  and bacteri al content, is more soluble, and has
fewer scorched particl es.
    There are still some man ufacturers of dry milk that sell ord inary
Grade A product,  but they are beco ming fewer.  Every brand of instant
powdered milk in my local grocery store is the Extra Grade, even the
generic store brand.  This, too, may var y outside of the States.
    (d)- Try to buy your dri ed milk in contain ers of a siz e that makes
sense for the level of consu mption in the hous ehold.  Once it is opene d,
powdered milk has a short shelf life bef ore undesira ble changes in
flavor and nutrient content occurs.  If you buy larg e packages and do
not use much at one time, consider  breaking it down and repackag ing into
smaller containe rs at the time of purchase.
    (e)- As with  any storage  food you buy, try  to deal onl y with
reputable dealers.  It is particul arly importa nt to do this with dry
milk because of its short shelf life and  sensitivity to storage
conditions.  Check expiration dates, then date and rotate packages.
     B.2  STORIN G OF DRY MIL KS
     Dry milk products  are probabl y the most sensiti ve to environmental
conditions storage foods there are, particularly to temperature and
moisture content .  Their vitamins A and D are also photose nsitive and
will break down rapidly if exposed  to light.
     The area where your dry  milk is stored should be kept  as cool as
possible.  If it is possible  to do so, air-con ditioning or even
refrigeration can grea tly extend the nut rient shelf life.     If the stor age containe r is transpa rent or tran slucent then it
should be put into a second container opaque to ligh t or stored in a
dark room.
     Dry milk will abs orb moisture  and odors from the air so storage
containers should be impervi ous to both air and mois ture.  The drier it
can be kept, the better it will keep.  The use  of desiccan ts is an
excellent idea.  Oxygen also speeds decomposition.  Powder ed milk canned
with nitrogen or carbo n dioxide to repla ce air (which contains oxygen)
will keep longer than powdered milk exposed to air.  Vacuum canning also
decreases the availabl e oxygen.
     If the dry milk purchas ed was not package d for long term storage
then it should be repa ckaged right away.
     I pur chase the instant variety at my loca l grocery and repa ck it
when I get it home.  I've seen a number of methods used for this  and any
of them should work.
     The method I now use is to pour the  powder into clean, dry
half-gallon canning jars.  Once the jars  are filled I add a small
desiccant pack and sea l.  They are  dated and stored in the ubiquitous
cool, dark place.  They must be guarded against breakage, but they off er
the advantage of not holding  odors, thus allowing for reus e after
suitable cleanin g.  Since they are  as transpar ent the cont ents must be
protected against light.  Vacuum sealing  and then storing in a dark
place may be the best method.  Larger jars of 1 gallon size could be
used and then re-vacuu m sealed after each use.  An O2 abso rber would
take care of any remaining oxygen and would, itself,  last longer when
used in conjunct ion with the  vacuum sealer.  Being glass, the jar can be
reused as well as the lid and ring  if they're properly cleaned.
     Clean , sound plastic one and two liter soda bot tles can als o be
used, but probably should be used just once since the plas tic is
somewhat permeab le and will hold odors.
     If you have  access to a can sealer,  #10 cans make won derful storage
containers for dry mil k, particularly if used in conjunction with O2
absorbers.
     Anoth er method I've see n used is to remov e the paper envelopes of
milk powder from the cardboa rd box they come from the groc ery store in
and to put them in dated plastic bags.  These bags are not  sealed.  The
unsealed bags are then  placed in a large r, air tight, opaque container.
I've heard of plastic buckets, fifty cal and 20 mm ammo cans bei ng used
for this purpose .  A healthy  quantity of desic cant was als o placed in
the container.  This would be anot her area whe re O2 absorption packets
should serve well.  It's imp ortant to remember  the contain ers should be
clean and odor-free.

     B.2.1   SHELF LIFE OF DRY MILK S     From:      SacoFoo ds@aol.com  (Amy Thompso n)
     To:       Dunross @dkeep.com  (Alan Hagan)
     Subj:      SACO Mix'nDri nk Instant Pure Skim Mil k

Dear Mr. Hagan:
     Thank  you for you r e-mail tod ay and for your interest  in SACO
Mix'nDrink Pure Skim Milk.
     Our Mix'n Drink will keep its  nutrition value for up to about two
years if kept cool and  dry, and the only  vitamins that act ually decrease
over time are the vita mins A and D.  The se are not shelf-stable vitamins
and are sensitiv e to heat and ligh t.  A good rule of thumb  to follow is
that the vitamin s A and D will dis sipate at a rate of abou t 20% every
year if stored properl y.  The less  heat and moisture  the milk is expos ed
to, the better the vit amins will keep.  A free zer could extend the she lf
life, as long as the powder does not get  moisture in it.  If you  had to
put a time limit on the Mix' nDrink, for rotation purposes, I would date
it at two years after the date of purchase.
     After  opening a package  of dry milk , transfer the pow der to a
tightly covered glass or metal container (dry milk can pic k up odors
from plastic containers) and keep it in the refriger ator.  Unsealed
nonfat dry milk keeps for a few months; dry whole milk for  a few weeks.

Dear Mr. Hagan:
     Since  vitamins A and D are heat and  light sensitive, I would say
that your 1 1/2 year shelf life is very reasonable.  If you are trying
to determi ne when the nutritional value has been aff ected more than 40%,
as you pre viously indicated, you should be pretty safe wit h that time
element, as long  as it is not expo sed to extre me heat.

C. CANNED GOODS
     C.1  CANNED  MILK TYPES
     Prese rved liquid milk comes in a number of form s, none of which are
very similar to each other.  The most common forms of thes e packaged
milks are as follows:
    CANNED  MILKS:  These are commonly called UHT mil ks (Ultra High
                   Tem perature) for the packaging techniqu e used to put
them up. They come in the same var ieties as fresh liquid milks:  Whole,
2%, 1% and skim.  I've even found whipping cream in UHT packagin g (GrandChef - Parmalat), though this may be offered only in the commerc ial and
restaurant trade.  In the U.S. the y have vitamin D added.  The lesser
fat content milks do not kee p as long as whole  milk and their use by
dates are correspondingly shorter term.  This milk is pack aged in
aseptic containe rs, either cans or lamin ated paper cartons .  It has the
same composition as fresh milk of the same typ e, and can be stor ed at
room temperature because of the special pasteurizing process used.  The
milk has a boile d flavor, but much  less than evapora ted milk.  The dat es
are usually for approximately six months.  The milk is still usable past
its date, but the flav or soon begins to go stale and the cream
separates.  I am told by a friend who lived in Germa ny not long after
this kind of canned milk beg an to come on the market there that they
were dated for a year.
     With a six-month shelf life this type of canned milk naturally
requires a much faster rotation cycle than oth er types.  The onl y brand
name for this milk I'v e seen is Parmalat .  Recently, I have discovered
that it makes excellen t yogurt, losing the boi led tasted
    EVAPOR ATED:    This is made from fre sh, unpasteu rized whole milk.  A
                   vac uum-heating process removes 60% of the wat er; the
concentrate is heated,  homogenized, and in the States vitamin D is
added.  It is then can ned and heat ed again to sterilize the cont ents.
It may als o have other nutrients and che mical stabilizers added.  A
mixture of one part water and one part evapora ted milk wil l have about
the same nutriti onal value of an equal amount of fresh milk.  There is
generally no date or use by code on evap orated milk
     Healt h and nutrition food sto res often carry canned, evaporated
goat's milk, in a similar concentr ation.
    SWEETE NED CONDENSE D:     This milk goes through much less processi ng
                             than evaporated milk.  It sta rts with
pasteurized milk combined with a sugar solutio n.  The wate r is then
extracted until the mixture is less than half its original  weight.  It
is not hea ted because the high sug ar content prevent s spoilage.  It's
very high in calories, too:  8 oz has 980 calo ries.
     Altho ugh it is often hard to find, the label has a stamped date
code which indicates the dat e by which it shou ld be consumed.
Sweetened, condensed milk may thic ken and dark en as it ages, but it is
still edible.
     C.1.1   SHELF LIFE OF CANNED MILKS
     Unope ned cans of evaporated milk can be stored on a cool, dry she lf
for up to six months.  Canned milk (UHT) should be stored till the
stamped date cod e on the pac kage (3 - 6 months ).  Check the date  on
sweetened, condensed milk for maxi mum storage.
                      
     C.2  CORROS ION PREVENTI ON OF CANNED GOODS
     Some areas have difficu lty storing metal canned goods for long
periods of time.   This is usually caused by very hig h humidity orexposure to salt  in a marine  environment.  If this is a problem,  it is
possible to exte nd the life of metal cans by coating  their outsides.
I've seen this used on boats  here in Florida, especially when loading
for a long trip.  There are at least four methods that can  be used to do
this:
     PARAF FIN METHOD:  Using a double boiler, paraffin is melted and
brushed on the clean, unrusted cans.  Be certa in to get a good coat on
all seams, particularly the joints.  If the can is small enough,  it can
be dipped directly into the wax.  Care must be taken  to not caus e the
labels to separate from the cans.  Do not leav e in long enough for the
can to get warm.
     PASTE  WAX METHOD:   Combine 2-3 oz. of paste or jelly wax with a
quart of mineral  spirits.  Warm the mixt ure CAREFULL Y in its con tainer
by immersi ng it in a larger container of hot water.  DO NOT HEAT  OVER AN
OPEN FLAME!  Stir the wax/spirits thoroughly until it is well mixed and
dissolved.  Paint the cans with a brush in the same manner as above.
Place the cans on a wire rac k until dry.
     SPRAY  SILICONE:  A ligh t coating of ordin ary spray silicone  may be
used to deter rust.  Spray lightly , allow to dry, wipe gen tly with a
clean cloth to remove excess silicone.
     CLEAR  COATING:  A clear  type of spray or brush on coating such as
Rustoleum may be appli ed.  This is best suited for larger resealable
cans, but will keep them pro tected from corrosion for year s.
                      
D. SUGAR, HONEY AND OTHER SWEETENE RS
     There  are a wide number of sugars to be found for pur poses of
sweetening foods.  Fructose is the primary sugar in fruit and honey;
maltose is one of the sugars in malted grains;  pimentose are fou nd in
olives and sucrose is what we know  as granulat ed or table sugar.
Sucrose is a hig hly refined product made primarily from sugar cane
though sugar beets still contribute a fair amo unt of the world supply.
Modern table sugar is now so highl y refined as to be virtu ally 100% pure
and nearly indestructible if prote cted from moisture .  Powdered sugar
and brown sugar are simple variati ons on granu lated sugar and share its
long life.
     Liqui d sweeteners do not have  quite the longevi ty of dry sugars.
Honey, cane syrup, molasses, corn syrup and maple syrup may crys tallize
or mold during long storage.   These syrups are chemically not as simpl e
as table sugar and the refore lose flavor and otherwi se break down over
time.
     D.1  TYPES OF GRANULATED SUGARS
     Buyin g granulated sugar and its clo se cousins is real ly a very
simple matter.  Buy a brand you know you  can trust and be certain the
package is clean , dry and has no insect infestation.  There's very
little that can go wrong with it.
    GRANUL ATED:    Granulated sugar does not spoil, but if it gets dam p
                   it will likely cake up or get lum py.  If it does, itcan simply be pulveriz ed again until it regains its granulated texture .
Granulated sugar can be foun d in varying  textures, coarser  or finer.
""Castor/caster sugar"" is a finer granula tion than what is commonly sold
as table sugar in the U.S. and is more closely  equivalent to our
super fine or berry sugar.
    POWDER ED,      All  names refer to the same  kind of sugar, that is
    CONFEC TIONERS, white granulated sugar very finely ground.  For
    ICING:          com mercial use there is a range of text ures from
                   coa rse to ultra -fine.  For home consump tion, what is
generally found is either Very Fin e (6X) or Ultra-Fine (10 X), but this
can vary from nation to nati on.  Not all  manufacturers will indicate the
grind on the pac kage though.   Sugar refiners usually  add a small  amount
of corn-starch to prev ent caking.
     Powde red sugar is as inert as granu lated sugar, but it is even more
hygroscopic and will absorb any moisture  present.  If it absorbs  more
than a little it may cake up and get har d.  It's dif ficult to reclaim
hardened powdere d sugar, but it can stil l be used like gra nulated sugar.
    BROWN,     In the United States brown sugar is basicall y just refined
LIGHT & DARK: white sugar that has  had a bit of mola sses or suga r syrup
              and cara mel coloring  added to it.  Dar k brown sugar has
more molasses which gives it a str onger flavor, a darker color and mak es
it damp.  Light brown sugar has less mol asses which gives it a milder
flavor, a blonde r color and is slightly dryer than the dar k variety.
For storage purposes you may  want to just stock the dark variety .  Light
brown sugar can be made by combini ng one fourth to one thi rd white sugar
to the rem ainder dark brown sugar and blend thorough ly.
     Both varieties need to be protected from drying out, or they will
become very hard and difficu lt to deal with.  Nor do you want to allow
them to become damper than what they alr eady are.
     There  are granula ted and liqu id brown sugars availabl e, but they
don't have the same cooking qualities as ordin ary brown sugars.  They
also don't dry out and  harden quite so readily  either.
    RAW, NATURAL ,  In recent years, sugar refiners have realized  that
    & TURB INADO:   there is a market for less refined forms of cane
                   sug ar in the U.S. and  have begun to sell this kind of
sugar under various names and pack agings.  None of it is really raw
sugar since it is ille gal to sell it in the U.S. due  to the high
impurities level in the trul y raw product.  All of it has been process ed
in some form or fashion to clean it, but  it has not been subject ed to
the full refinin g and whitening processe s of ordinar y white table sugar.
This leaves some of the natu ral color and a mild fla vor in the
sweetener.  All of these less refined sugars may be stored and handled
like brown sugar.
     Outsi de of the United States it is possible to buy truly raw suga r
and it can be found under names such as ""muscavado"", ""jaggery"" (usuall y
a raw palm  or date sug ar), ""demera ra"" and othe rs.  With all of the
molasses and oth er impurities retained it is quite strong in flavor so
would not be suited to gener al use, but there are recipes that call for
it.  In spite of moist ure and impu rities it can be stored like brownsugar since its sugar content is high enough to inhi bit most mic robial
growth.
     D.1.1   STORING GRANULAT ED SUGARS
     All granula ted sugars have basicall y the same storage  requirements.
They need to be kept in air tight, insect and moisture proof containers.
For powdered, and gran ulated sugar you might want to consi der using some
desiccant in the storage container if your loc al climate is damp .  Since
brown sugars and raw sugars are supposed  to be moist , they do not need
desiccants.  Shelf life is indefin ite if kept dry, but any thing that you
intend to eat really should be rotated over time.  Time has a way of
affecting even the mos t durable of foods .
     I've used brown sugar that was six years old at the time it was
removed from sto rage and, other than the  molasses settling  somewhat
toward the bottom, it was just fin e.  A friend  to whom I gave a bucket
of the bro wn sugar finished it off three years after I gave it to her
which was nine years after it was packaged and it, too, was fine .
     D.2  TYPES OF HONEY
     Honey  is probably  the oldest sweetener known to man. Its use
predates recorde d history and has been found in the Egyptian pyramids.
It's typically sweeter  than granulated sugar by a factor of 25%- 40%
depending upon the spe cific flowers from which the bees gather their
nectar.  This means a smalle r amount of honey can give the  same amount
of sweeten ing as sugar .  The source flowers also dic tate the fla vor and
the color of the sweetener as well .  Honey color can range from very
dark (nearly black) to almos t colorless.  As a gener al rule, the lighter
the color and the more  delicate the flav or, the grea ter the pric e the
honey will bring.  As you might expect, since honey is sweeter than
table sugar, it also has mor e calories as well  -- 22 per teaspoo n
compared to gran ulated sugar's 16 per teaspoon .  There are also trivial
amounts of miner als and vita mins in the bee product while white sugar
has none.
     Raw honey may als o contain minute quantit ies of botul inum spores
and should not be fed to children under one year of age.  PLEASE  READ
THE POST FROM GERI GUI DETTI CONCERNING THIS BELOW.  Raw honey is OK for
older children and adu lts.  Honey is not a direct substitu te for table
sugar however, its use  in recipes may call for  a bit of alterati on to
get it to turn out rig ht.
     Honey  comes in a number  of forms in the retail market and they all
have different storage  characteristics:
WHOLE-COMB:   This is the bee prod uct straight  from the hive.  It is the
              most unp rocessed form in which honey comes, being found as
              large pieces of waxy  comb floating in raw honey.  The comb
              itself will contain many unopene d honey cells.
RAW:          This is unheated honey that has been removed  from the
              comb.  It may contain bits of wax, ins ect parts and othe r              small detritus .
FILTERED:     This is raw honey that has  been warmed to make it more
              easy to filter out small particl es and impurities.  Other
              than bei ng somewhat cleaner than raw honey it is
              essentia lly the same .  Most of the tra ce amounts of
              nutrient s remain intact.
LIQUID:       This is honey that has bee n heated to higher temperatures
              to allow  for easier filtering and to kill any
              microorg anisms.  Usually lighter  in color, this form is
              milder in flav or, resists crystallization and gene rally
              clearer.   It stores the best of the various forms of
              honey.  Much of the trace amounts of vitamin s, however,
              are lost .
SPUN or       This hon ey has had some of its moistur e content removed to
CRYSTALLIZED:  make a creamy  spread.  It is the most  processed form of
              honey.
     D.2.1   BUYING HONEY
     Much of the honey sold in supermarkets has been  blended from a
variety of diffe rent honeys and some may  have even had oth er sweeteners
added as well.  Like anythin g involving humans, buying honey can be a
tricky business.  It pays to deal with individ uals and bra nds you know
you can trust.  In the  United States you should buy products labeled
U.S. GRADE A or U.S. FANCY if buyi ng in retail outlets.  However , be
aware there are no federal labelin g laws governing the sal e of honey, so
only honey labeled pure is entirel y honey and not blended with other
sweeteners.  Honey grading is a matter of volu ntary compliance which
means some producers may be lax and slop py about it.  This can be a real
nuisance when producer s use words like ""organi c"", ""raw"", ""uncook ed"" and
""unfiltered"" on their labels, possibly to misl ead.  Fortun ately, most
honey producers are quite honest in thei r product labeling  so if you'r e
not certain of who to deal with, it is worthwh ile to ask around to find
out who produces  a good product.
     Honey  may also contain trace amounts of drugs used in treat ing
various bee ailm ents, including antibiot ics.  If thi s is a conce rn to
you, then it would be wise to inve stigate with your local honey producer
what has been used.
     D.2.2   STORING HONEY
     Honey  is much eas ier to store  than to select and buy.   Pure honey
won't mold, but may crystall ize over tim e.  Exposure  to air and moisture
can cause color to darken and flav or to intensify and may speed
crystallization as well.  Comb hon ey doesn't store as well  liquid honey
so you sho uld not expe ct it to last as long.
     Stora ge temperature is not as impor tant for hon ey, but it should be
kept from freezing and not exposed  to high tem peratures if possi ble.Either extreme can cau se crystallization and heat may caus e flavor to
strengthen undesirably.
     Filte red liquid honey will last the  longest in storage.  Storage
containers should be opaque,  airtight, moistur e and odor-proof.  Like
any other stored food, honey should be rotated  through the storage cycle
and replaced with fresh product.
     If crystall ization does occur, honey can be reliquified by placing
the container in a lar ger containe r of hot wat er until it has melted.
     Avoid  storing honey near heat sources and if using plastic pails
don't keep it near pet roleum products (includi ng gasoline/diesel
engines), chemicals or any other odor-producin g products.

    Yes, raw hon ey can contain the temperature resistant spores of
""Clostridium botulinum"", the bacterium that causes botulis m.  The
organism is a strict anaerob e, meaning that it only grows in the absence
of molecul ar oxygen.  The problem with infants  and honey is that  the
small, intestinal tract of an infa nt apparently is suffici ently
anaerobic to allow the spores to germina te into actively growing  C.
botulinum organisms.  Essent ially, the infant serves the same role as a
sealed, airtight , contaminated can of beans as far as the organisms are
concerned.  There in the inf ant's body the bac teria secrete the
dangerous toxin that causes the symptoms  of botulism .  There have been
quite a few docu mented infant deaths due to honey.  As I recall,  the
studies identify ing honey as the source were done in the '80s.  Most
pediatricians recommen d no honey for the  first year.  It is prob ably
best to check with you r own for even lat er updates...Geri Guidetti, The
Ark Institute

     Q:  My can of honey is bulging.  Is it safe to use?
     A:  Honey can rea ct with the can lining to rele ase a gas especial ly

     D.3  TYPES OF CANE SYRUPS.
MOLASSES &    These two swee teners are not pre cisely the same thing.
CANE SYRUP:   Molasses  is a by-pro duct of suga r refining and can e syrup
              is simpl y cane juice boiled down to a syrup,  in much the
              same way  as maple syrup is produ ced.  Non-Southern ers
              (U.S.) may kno w it better as unsulphured molasses even if
              this is not complete ly correct.  Sulphured molasse s is
              also ava ilable on the mark et and very cheap as well, but
              it's str ong flavor is unat tractive and generally not
              desirabl e.
SORGHUM:      This is produced in the same man ner as cane syrup, but
              sorghum cane, rather than sugar cane, is used.  Sorghum
              tends to have a thinner, slightl y sourer taste than cane
              syrup.
TREACLE:      This swe etener comes in varying colors from a rather dark
              version,  similar to, but not qui te the same as blackstrap
              molasses , to paler version s more similar to golden syrup.
    All of the above syrups are generall y dark with a rich, heavy
flavor.
GOLDEN SYRUP: This syr up seems to be both lighter and pale r in color
              than any  of the abov e three, probably more similar  to what
              we would  call a table syrup here in the U.S.
TABLE SYRUP:  There are many  table syrups sold in supermar kets, some
              with fla vorings of one sor t or another  such as maple,
              various fruits, etc.  A close examinat ion of the
              ingredie nts list wil l reveal mixtures of cane syrup, cane
              sugar syrup or corn syrup along with preserv atives,
              coloring s and other additives.  They usually  have a much
              less pro nounced flavor than molasses, cane syrup, sorghum
              or the darker treacles.  Any syr up containing corn syrup
              should be stor ed as corn syrup.
     D.3.1   STORING CANE SYR UPS
     All of the above syrups, except for those having corn syrup in
their makeup, have the  same storage characteristics.  They can be stor ed
on the she lf for about two years and up to a year after opening.   Once
they are opened,  they are best kep t in the ref rigerator to retar d mold
growth.  If mold  growth does occur, the syrup should be discarde d.  The
outside of the bottle should be cleaned of drips after each use.  Some
pure cane and sorghum syrups may crystal lize in stor age, but thi s causes
no harm and they  can be reli quified using the same method as for honey.     D.4  CORN SYRUP
     Corn syrup is a liquid sweetener made by an enzyme reaction  with
corn-starch.  Availabl e in both a light and a dark form, the dar ker
variety has a flavor similar  to molasses  and contain s refiners syrup (a
byproduct of sugar refining).  Both types often contain flavorin gs and
preservatives.  It is commonly used in baking and candy making because
it does not crys tallize when heated.  Corn syr up is very common in the
U.S., but less so in the res t of the wor ld.
     Corn syrup stores poorly compared to othe r sweeteners and because
of this it often  has a best if used by dating code on the bottle.  It
should be stored in its orig inal bottle,  tightly capped, in a cool, dry
place.  New unop ened bottles  keep about six months from the date  on the
label.  After opening,  keep the corn syr up four to six mon ths.  These
syrups are very prone to mold and to fermentation so be on the lookout
for bubbling or a mold haze.  If these present  themselves, throw the
syrup out.  You should always be certain  to wipe off  any drips from the
bottle after every use.
     D.5  MAPLE SYRUP
    Maple syrup is produced by boiling down sap of the map le tree until
it reaches  a syrup consistency and is slightly  sweeter than table sugar.
Maple syrup is judged by much the same criteri a as honey:  Lightness of
color, clarity and tas te.  Pure maple is gener ally expensi ve and most
pancake syrups are cor n and cane sugar syrups with either natural or
artificial flavorings.  Maple flavored pancake  syrups should be kept and
stored as corn syrups.
    New unopened  bottles of maple syrup may be kept on a cool, dark,
shelf for up to two years.  The sweetene r may darken and the fla vor get
stronger, but it is still usable.
    After the bottle has bee n opened, it shoul d be refrige rated.  It
will last about a year.  Be careful to look out for mold growth.   If
mold occurs, discard the syr up.
                      
E. FATS AND OILS
     All oils are fats , but not all fats  are oils.  They are ver y
similar to each other in their chemical makeup, but what makes one an
oil and another a fat is the percentage of hydrogen saturation in the
fatty acids of which they are comp osed.  The fats and oils  which are
available to us for culinary  purposes are actu ally mixture s of differi ng
fatty acids so for pra ctical purposes we'll say satu rated fats are sol id
at room temperat ure (70 deg.  F) and unsa turated fats we call oil s are
liquid at room tempera ture.  For dietary  and nutriti on purposes fats are
generally classified as satu rated, monosaturated and polyunsaturated,
which is a furth er refinement of the amo unt of satur ation of the
particular compositions of fatty acids in the fats.
     E.1  BUYING  AND STORING  OILS AND FATS     There  is a proble m with storing oils and fats for the  long term and
that is the fact  that they go ranc id rather quickly.   Rancid fats have
been implicated in increased rates of heart disease,  atherosclerosis and
are carcinogenic (cancer causing) so we want to avoi d them if possible .
     Oxyge n is eight times more soluble in fat than in water and it is
the oxidation resultin g from this exposure that is the pri mary cause of
rancidity.  The more polyuns aturated a fat is,  the faster it will go
rancid.  This may not,  at first, be read ily apparent  because vegetable
oils have to become several times more rancid than animal fats before
our noses can detect it.  An extre me example of ranc idity is the linseed
oil (flaxseed) that we use as a wood fin ish and a base for  oil paints.
In just a matter  of hours the oil oxidizes into a solid polymer.   This
is very desirabl e for wood and pai nt, very und esirable for food.
     Becau se of this difficu lty in stori ng fats and oils for any  long
period of time many books and arti cles on the subject of food storage
make only passing mention of them,  if they say  anything at all.  This is
unfortunate because fat cont ains nine calories  to the gram  compared to
the four calorie s contained by either carbohyd rates or protein.  This
makes fat a valuable source of concentrated calories  that could be of
real importance if faced with a diet con sisting largely of unref ined
grains and legumes.  For sma ll children, infants and the elderly , they
may not be able to consume the vol ume of food that would be nece ssary in
the course of a day to get all of the calories  they would need to avoi d
weight loss and possible malnutrition.  Additi onally, fats play an
important role in our perception of tast e and texture and their absence
would make many foods more difficu lt to prepare and consume.
Furthermore, a small amount of dietary fat is necessary for our bodies
to properl y absorb fat soluble vitamins like A,D,E and K.
     Long term storage  of fats may  be problema tical, but it is not
impossible.  There are some general rules you can follow to get the most
life out of your  stored cooking oils and  fats.
    #1   Exposur e to oxygen,  light and heat are the greatest factors to
         rancidi ty.  If you can, refrige rate your stored oil,
particularly after it's been opened.  If possi ble, buy you r oils in
opaque, airtight  containers.  If you pur chase it in plastic,
particularly clear plastic, then transfe r it to a gas impe rmeable glass
or metal contain er that can be sealed airtight .  If you have a means of
doing so, vacuum sealing the storage container is an excel lent idea as
it removes  most of the air remaini ng inside, taking much of the oxygen
with it.  Transp arent glass and plastic containers should be stored in
the dark, such as in a box.  Regardless of the storage container, it
should be stored at as cool a temperature as possibl e and rotated as
fast as is pract ical.  Oils and fats wit h preservatives added by the
manufacturer will have a greater shelf life than tho se without them,
provided they are fres h when purchased.
    #2   Unless they have been spe cially treated, unopened  cooking oils
         have a shelf life of abou t a year, dependin g upon the above
conditions.  Some specialty oils such as sesam e and flax seed have
shorter usable lives.  If you don' t use a great deal of it, try to not
buy your fats in large  containers.  This way you won 't be exposing a
large quantity to the air after the you' ve opened it, to grow old and
possibly rancid,  before you can use it all up.   Once opened, it is an
excellent idea to refr igerate cooking fats.  If it turns cloudy orsolid, the fat is stil l perfectly usable and will return to its normal
liquid, clear state after it has warmed to room temperature.  Left at
room temperatures, opened bottles of cooking oils can begi n to rancid in
anywhere from a week to a couple of mont hs, though it may take several
more months to reach such a point of rancidity that it can be smelled.
    #3    Althou gh darker colored oils have more fla vor than pal er
         colored , the agents that contribute to that  flavor and color
also contribute to faster rancidit y.  For maxi mum shelf life buy  paler
colored oils.
    #4   If you have no part icular problem with using it, the culinary
         fat wit h the most shelf life as it comes from the  store is
hydrogenated shortening in its uno pened metal or metal lined can.  The
brand most familiar in the U.S. is proba bly Crisco, but there are many
others.  Solid shorten ing is usual ly composed of partially hydrogenated
vegetable oils, but there are some  that also contain  animal fats.  Some
brands will also contain anti-oxidant preserva tives as well.  All othe r
conditions being equal, those with preservatives will have a longer
shelf life than those without.  It is not poss ible to give  an exact
answer, but it is reas onable to expect an unop ened metal can of
shortening to have a shelf life of eight  to ten year s if kept reasonab ly
cool, particularly if it has preservatives in it.
     E.2  EXTEND ING SHELF LIFE BY ADDING ANTI-OXIDANTS
     If obtainin g the maximum shelf life in your coo king oils is
important to you, it is poss ible to add anti-oxidant preservatives to
the fat after you have  purchased it.  Used in conjunction with a gas
impermeable container, either opaque in color or stored in a dar k place,
and cool storage  temperatures (70 F or less) then shelf life can  be
extended to abou t five years, possibly longer.
     The anti-oxidant in question is Butylated HydroxyToluene (BHT).  It
is used in the food industry  to slow the  development of off-flav ors,
odors and color changes caused by oxidation, mostly in foods that are
high in fats and  oils.  BHT is on the U.S. Foo d and Drug
Administration's Generally Recogni zed As Safe (GRAS) list as a common
preservative.  The FDA  limits the use of BHT to 0.02 % or 200 par ts per
million (ppm) of the oil or fat content of a food product.   The
directions that I will be giving below will be for the FDA  limit, but
there are those who choose to use up to ten times that amo unt as part of
their life extension program s.  The leve l you choose is up to you.
     BHT is avai lable over the cou nter in the retail trade, but you have
to know where to look for it.  The  only retail distributor of the
anti-oxidant that I am thus far aware of is
    Twin Laborat ories (TwinLab),
    Ronkon koma, NY 11779.
    Their BHT comes in the form of 250 mg gela tin capsules .  I've been
able to find the ir product in seve ral local health food stores.  It is
also available through  mail order sources, but I don't have any names or
addresses for that ave nue yet.
     To get the best results  you will need the  freshest oil you canfind.  Purchasing it from a large,  busy supermarket will probabl y
suffice.  You'll  also need contain ers that are  gas imperme able such as
glass jars, or metal cans.  There may be plast ic containers with high
gas barrier properties that will also serve, but I cannot knowledgeably
say about this.  It is impor tant that your con tainers are food grade and
are clean, dry and dus t-free.
     Each 250 milligra m capsule is suffi cient to treat 47 fluid ounces
of cooking  oil (as per  the GRAS guidelin es mentioned above).  If you
have an accurate  means of weighing  this works out to be 5.3 mg of BHT
crystals to ever y 1 fl oz of oil.  If you're using a scale  calibrated in
grains, such as a reloading powder scale, you may use the following
table.
         BHT                                          BHT
     in grains               OIL                 in milligrams
     ---------------------------------------------------------
     0.1 grain           1 fl oz                   5.3 mg
     0.7 grain           8 fl oz (1 cup)           42.4 mg
     1.3 grain          16 fl oz (1 pint )         84.8 mg
     2.6 grain          32 fl oz (1 quar t)       169 .6 mg
     5.2 grain          64 fl oz (1/2 gal)       339 .2 mg
     10.3 grain        128 fl oz (1 gal)          678 .4 mg
    NOTE:     The grai n weight measurements have bee n rounded up to the
nearest tenth grain since most pow der scales will not accu rately measure
less than one-tenth of a gra in.
    IMPORT ANT NOTE:     If you are  using a reloading powder scale, be
sure the balance  pan is clea n and the balance has been cal ibrated
recently with a reliab le set of check weights.
     Remov e the BHT crystals  from their gelatin capsules and wei gh, if
you're going to.  Once you have the appr opriate amount, add the crystals
to a pint or so of the oil, shaking vigorously.  It may take sev eral
hours for the preserva tive to diss olve complet ely.  Bringi ng the oil up
to a warm,  NOT HOT, temperat ure will spe ed the process.  Once complete ly
dissolved, pour the anti-oxi dant laden oil int o the rest of the oil and
mix thoroughly.  Once mixed, the oil can  then be poured into its  storage
containers leaving approximately 1/2 inc h of headspa ce.  If you have a
vacuum sealer the jars  or cans may  be vacuum sealed to remove most of
the oxygen from the containe r, otherwise just seal the lid .  Store in a
cool place and if usin g transparent jars, be certain  to put them  in a
larger container such as a box to keep the con tents in the dark.  Don't
forget to label and date the  jars.
     There  are other preserv atives in food ind ustry use that wil l also
work, but I have not yet dis covered how they are use d or where to get
them.  I'm currently looking  for informa tion on Buty lated HydroxyAnisole
(BHA), propyl gallate,  vitamin E (the tocopher ols, natural  and
synthetic), ascorbyl palmita te (a fat soluble form of vita min C), citr ic
acid and mono-Tertiary -ButylHydroQuinone (TBHQ).  Addition ally, certain
herbs and spices like cloves, rosemary, oregano, sage and vanilla also
have antioxidant properties, sometimes quite strong ones.  Being
strongly flavore d, they are not suitable  as preserva tives in fats meant
for general use, but will lend the ir protective properties in any
recipes that cal l for them.     Befor e I close out this  section on fats and oil s, please allow me
to reempha size that no amoun t of preserv atives that can be added  to your
stored fats will substitute for proper storage  and rotatio n.  The more  I
research the che mistry and physiol ogical effects of rancid fats the more
I come to believe they are bad new s for long term health, particularly
as we grow  older.  Don't sit on your oil  supply for years without
rotating it.  Just a little bit rancid is just  a little bit pois onous.
`Nuff said.
     
F. COOKING  STAPLES
     F.1  BAKING  POWDER.
     This powder is a combin ation of an acid and an alkali with starch
added to keep the othe r two ingredients stable and dry.  The pow der
reacts with liquid by foaming and the resultin g bubbles can aera te and
raise dough.  Almost all bak ing powder now on the market is doub le
acting, meaning it has one acid that bub bles at room  temperature and
another acid whi ch only reacts at oven tempera tures.  Unless a recipe
specifies otherwise, this is the type to use.
     Don't  expose baking powder to steam , humid air, wet spoons,  or any
other moisture.  Store in a tightl y lidded container for no more  than a
year.  Even when kept bone dry it will eventua lly loses its pote ncy.  To
test its strengt h, measure 1 tsp powder into 1/3 cup  hot water.  The
mixture should fizz and bubb le furiously.  If it doesn't, throw it out.
     For those folks concern ed with aluminum in the diet, the Rumford
brand has none in it and the re may be others.
     F.2  BAKING  SODA.
     This gritty powder is sodium bicarbonate also called sodium acid
bicarbonate (NaHCO3), a mild alkali.  It is used in baking to leaven
bread and other baked or fried foods and does so in the same man ner as
baking powder.  It can  also be used to make hominy.  When combined with
an acid ingredie nt, the bica rbonate reacts to give off car bon dioxide
bubbles which causes the bak ed good to rise.  If kep t well sealed in an
air- and moistur e-proof container its storage life is inde finite.  If
kept in the card board box it usual ly comes in, it will kee p for about
eighteen months.   Do keep in mind that baking soda is a wonderfu l odor
adsorber.  If you don' t want your baked goods tasting of whateve r smells
it adsorbe d then keeping it in an airtight container is an excel lent
idea.
     
     F.3  HERBS AND SPICES.
     It is diffi cult to give  exact instructions on how bes t to store
culinary herbs and spi ces because there are dozens of diff erent seeds,
leaves, roots, barks, etc., we call an herb or a spi ce.  There are,
however, some general rules to be followed to best preserv e their
flavors.  All spices, particularly dried, are especially sensiti ve to
heat, air and light.  Room tempera ture is sati sfactory for keeping them
and refrigeration or freezin g is even better, but they sho uld be keptaway from heat sources .  It is common for the household spice cabinet or
shelf to be loca ted over the  stove, but this is real ly a very poor
place.  Dark opa que glass is best for storage,  but failing  that, keeping
a tightly sealed glass container in a dark pla ce is next best.  The
cellophane packets some products come in just won't do.  Tightly  sealed
metal containers will work as well .  Even dense plastic will do,  but
glass is best.
     Where  possible, buy spi ces whole.  Whole nutmegs will keep their
flavor far longer than ground nutmeg, the same  for other seeds and
roots.  You'll have to use a grate r, grinder or what ever, but the
difference in flavor will be worth  it.
     If you buy spices in bulk con tainers (which is certainly cheaper)
consider transfe rring some into smaller containers and kee ping the
larger one tightly sealed in a coo l, dark place.  This wil l prevent
unwanted light and air  from continually getting in and pla ying havoc.
     Inclu ded in the supplie rs addresses are listing s for several spice
and herb compani es.  The one  I have personally dealt with so far is
Penzey's and the ir products have been consiste ntly excelle nt with good
prices.  It's worth investig ating some of thes e companies as they can
really take the sting out of purch asing large quantities.
     F.4  SALT.
     Stora ge life for salt is inde finite.  So long as you do not let it
get contaminated with dirt or what ever, it will never go bad.  Over
time, iodized salt may  turn yellow, but this is harm less and may  still
be used.  Salt is rath er hygroscopic and will adsorb moisture from the
air if not sealed in an air- tight container.  If it does adsorb moisture
and cakes up, it can be drie d in the ove n and then broken up with no
harm done.
     All salt, however , is not the  same.  Salt comes in a number  of
different varieties, and ver y little of what is prod uced in the U.S. is
intended for use  in food.  The res t of it, abo ut 98%, has other uses.
Therefore, it is impor tant to be certain  the salt you have  is intended
for human consumption.  Once you are sat isfied it is, you should then
determine its appropri ateness for the tasks to which  you might want to
set it to.  Below is a parti al list of some of the availab le salts
    TABLE SALT:    This is by far the most wid ely known type of salt.
                   It comes in two varieties; iodized and non-iodized.
There is an ingr edient added to it to adsorb moistur e so it will  stay
free flowing in damp weather .  This non-caking agent does not dissolve
in water and can  cause cloudiness in whatever solution it is used if
sufficiently large quantities are used.  In canning it won't cause a
problem since there is very little per jar.  For pic kling, though, it
would be noticea ble.  If you  are storing  salt for this pur pose, you
should be sure to choo se plain pickling salt, or other food grade pure
salt such as kosher salt.  In the iodized varieties, the iodine can
cause discoloration or darke ning of pick led foods so be certain not to
use it for that purpose.  For folk s who come from areas that are
historically iodine deficien t a store of iodiz ed salt for table
consumption is of real  importance.    CANNIN G SALT:  This is pure salt and  nothing but salt.  It can
                   usu ally be foun d in the can ning supplie s section of
most stores.  This is the salt to be preferred for most food
preservation or storage uses.  It is generally about the same grain size
as table salt.
    KOSHER  SALT:   This salt is not real ly, in itsel f, kosher, but is
                   use d in ""kasher ing"" meat to make the flesh kosher for
eating.  This involves  first soaking the meat then rubbing  it with the
salt to draw out  the blood which is not- kosher and is subs equently
washed off along with the salt.  The cle ansed meat is then  kosher.  What
makes it of inte rest for foo d storage and pres ervation is that it is
generally pure salt suitable  for canning , pickling and mea t curing.  It
is of a larger grain size than tab le or canning salt, and usually rolled
to make the grai ns flaked for easi er dissolving.  Frequent ly it is
slightly cheaper  than canning salt and usually  easier to find in
urban/suburban areas.
    NOTE:     Not all brands of kosher salt are exac tly alike.  Diamon d
Crystal Kosher Salt is the only brand that I'm  aware of that is not
flaked, but stil l in its una ltered crystal form.  The Mort on brand of
Coarse Kosher Salt has  ""yellow prussiate of soda"" added as an
anti-caking agent.  Morton still recomme nds it for picklin g and even
gives a kosher dill recipe on the box so I pre sume that this par ticular
anti-caking agent does not cause cloudin ess in pickl ing solution s.
     Wheth er flaked or in its unal tered crystal form, kosher salt takes
up more volume for an equivalent amount of mass than does canning salt.
If it is importa nt to get a very precise  amount of salt in your pickling
or curing recipe you may wan t to weigh the sal t to get the  correct
amount.
    SEA SALT: This typ e of salt comes in about  as many dif ferent
              varietie s as coffee and from abo ut as many differe nt
places around the worl d.  The ""gou rmet"" versions can be rather
expensive.  In general , the types sold in groc ery stores, natural food
markets and gour met shops have bee n purified enough to use in food.
It's not suitabl e for food preserv ation, though, because the min eral
content it conta ins (other than the sodi um chloride) may cause
discoloration of the food.
    ROCK or ICE    This type of salt com es in large chunky crystals and
    CREAM SALT:    is intended primarily for use in home ice cre am
                   chu rns to lower  the tempera ture of the ice filled
water in which the chu rn sits.  It's als o sometimes used in icin g down
beer kegs or watermelons.  It is used in food preservation by some, but
none of the bran ds I have been abl e to find label it as food gra de nor
do they specific ally mention  its use in foods so I would not use  it for
this purpose.
    SOLAR SALT:    This is also sometime s confusingly called ""sea salt"".
                   It is not, however, the sam e thing as the sea  salt
found in food stores.  Most importantly, it is not food grade.  It's mainpurpose is for use in water softeners.  The reason it is called ""solar""
and sometimes ""sea sal t"" is that it is produce d by evapora tion of sea
water in large ponds in vari ous arid are as of the world.  This salt type
is not pur ified and still contains  the desicca ted remains of whatever
aquatic life mig ht have been trapped in it.  Those organic  remains might
react with the protein s in the foo ds you are attempt ing to prese rve and
cause it to spoi l.
    HALITE :   For thos e of us fort unate enough to live in areas warm
              enough not nee d it, halite is the salt  that is used on
roads to melt snow and  ice.  It, too, is not food grade and shou ld not
be used in food preservation.  This form of salt is also frequen tly
called rock salt, like the rock salt abo ve, but neit her are suit able for
food use.
    SALT      These are vari ous other kinds of metal  salts such as
SUBSTITUTES:  potassiu m chloride used to subst itute for the ordi nary
              sodium chlorid e (NaCl) salt we are fam iliar with.  They
have their uses, but should not be used in foods undergoing a heated
preservation processing, as they can cau se the product to taste bad.
Even the heat from nor mal cooking is sometimes sufficient to cause this.
     F.5  VINEGA R.
     There  is vinegar and then the re is vinegar and it is not all alik e.
The active ingredient in all vinegars is aceti c acid, but how the sour
stuff was made can var y widely.  The mos t common vinegar is whit e
distilled which is actually just diluted  distilled acetic acid and not
true vinegar at all.  It kee ps pretty much ind efinitely if tight ly
sealed in a plastic or glass  bottle with a plastic cap.  The ena mel
coated metal caps always seem to get eat en by the acid ove r time.  It is
usually about 5-6% ace tic acid and  for picklin g it is the type most
often called for.
     The next most com mon variety is apple cider vinegar.  There are two
kinds of this type.  A cider  flavored distille d acetic acid type and a
true cider vinegar fermented from hard cider.  Either will store
indefinitely at room tempera ture until a sedim ent begins to appe ar on
the bottom.  Stored vinegar will sometim es develop a cloud y substance.
This is called a mothe r of vinegar  and it is harmles s.  As long as the
liquid does not begin to smell foul it can be filtered out through
cheesecloth or a coffe e filter and rebottled in a clean containe r.  The
mother can even be used to make more vin egar.  If it begin s to smell
bad, however, it's gon e over and should be tossed out.
     The more exotic wine, balsalm ic and other vinegars can be stored
like cider vinegar.  Age and  exposure to light  and air, however,
eventually begin to take the ir toll on their delicat e flavors.  Tightl y
capped in a cool, dark cabinet or refrigerator is best for  their
storage.
     F.6  YEAST.
     Yeast  is just not  a product you can  stow away and for get aboutuntil you need it next  year.  It is, aft er all, a living organis m and if
it's not alive at the time you nee d it, you won't get any use out of it.
This ancient leavening, brewing, ferment ing agent is a sin gle celled
microscopic fungus.  When we incor porate it into our  bread dough, beer
wort or fruit juice it begin s to reprodu ce madly (we hope) and produce
several by-produ cts.  If you 're baking, the by-produ ct you want is
carbon dioxide which is trap ped by the dough and sub sequently causes it
to rise.  In bre wing or vint ning what is wante d is the eth yl alcohol
and, if the drin k is to be carbona ted, the car bon dioxide as well.
     Almos t all yeasts used for these purposes  are in the same genus
(""Saccharomyces"" or sugar fungi), but several different species have
evolved and some  are more suitable  for a parti cular task than others.
It's entirely possible  to use groc ery store bread yeast to brew beer or
ferment wine, but the results may leave a great deal to be desir ed.
It's also possible to use yeast from bee r brewing to make bread and from
what I've read the res ults were pretty much indistin guishable from bre ad
yeast.
     Leavi ng aside the brewing and vintning yeasts which are rea lly
outside the scop e of this FAQ I am going  to concentr ate on bread  yeast.
It comes in two generally availabl e forms; compressed or fresh and
dried, sometimes called granular or inst ant active dry yea st.  They are
different genetic strains of the same species,  and have differen t
characteristics.
     Compr essed yeast is only partly dried (about 70% mois ture) and
requires refrige ration and keeps even better in the deep freeze.   If
kept in an air- and moisture -tight container to prev ent it from
desiccating this type of yeast will keep for a year in the freezer
(0 deg. F or les s), but only  about two weeks (maybe a bit more) in the
refrigerator.  Unless your kitchen  is rather chilly it will not keep on
the shelf.  It should not have a mottled  color or a sour odor.
     Dried  yeast has only an 8% moisture  content and comes packed in
foil envelopes.  The smaller  single use packets are not generall y vacuum
packed, but the larger commercial sized ""bricks"" of about a pound or two
each generally are.  They can last  for months on the shelf, until the
expiration date which should be clearly stamped on the pac kage.  If
packaged in the same manner as recommended for compressed yeast above
and kept in the refrigerator or freezer it can last for several years.
The larger packs of yeast should be tran sferred to an air and moisture
tight container after opening.
     Eithe r type of yeast can be tested for viabilit y by proofin g it.
This is nothing more than mixing a small  amount of the yea st with an
equal amount of sugar in warm water (105-115 deg. F for dried;  95 deg .
F for fres h).  Within about five minutes  active yeast will become bubbly
and begin to expand (at norm al room temperature).  Yeast which only
slowly becomes active can still be used,  but you wil l have to use more
of it.  If it shows no activ ity at all, it's dead and shou ld be thrown
out.
     There  is another means of providing yeast for baking besides buying
it from the groc ery store and that  is by using  a sourdough starter.  I'm
not going to address it here , but I will point out that it has a
newsgroup all its own (rec.food.sourdough) and several FAQ's devoted to
it.  You can fin d addresses for these FAQs in the Resource s section.Drop in and read  for awhile and you'll learn more than you  thought you
could ever want to know.
G. INFANT FORMULA
     Since  most folks interested in food  storage are planning for
families, real or as yet hyp othetical, I thoug ht it important to inclu de
something on infant formula.   Most baby food that comes in jars can be
treated like can ned goods of simil ar types meant for adults.  Formula,
though, is somet hing else.  I have  to admit, that not yet having kids of
my own, I've not  given this much thought  before so the bel ow is taken
from the book KEEPING FOOD FRESH, by Janet Bailey (see boo k list).  In
the future, if some of you readers  will send it to me and/ or I come up
with more information from my own researches I want to expand this
section on infan t/child food storage.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Prepa red infant formula  is primaril y water and nonfat cow's milk.
Among other ingredients, it contains sweeteners; sometimes lactose which
is milk sugar; and som etimes corn syrup or other sugars.  Coconu t and
soybean oils are  common; vitamin and min eral supplem ents are uni versal.
A few bran ds contain mono- and dig lycerides, chemica ls that keep the
liquid from separating.
     BUYIN G AND STORING INFANT FORMULA.  Canned liquid infant formula
comes either ready to eat or in a concen trate to be diluted with water.
Cans and packing  cases are clearly  marked with a ""use by"" date.
     Unope ned cans sto red in a coo l, dry place keep well from twelve to
eighteen months (longer than the baby is an infant).
     After  the can is opened, measure out the amount of formula you
need, cover the can and stor e in the ref rigerator.  It wil l keep no more
than 48 hrs at 40 deg.  F.  Never return leftover formula from the bott le
to the sto rage contain er and do not stor e half used bottles.
     You can pre -measure the whole can-full into ste rilized baby
bottles, seal them, and stor e them in the refr igerator, but fort y eight
hours is still the lim it.  To keep  full bottles from tipping over in the
refrigerator, slip the m into a carton from a six-pac k of soda pop
bottles.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
     In examinin g the offerings at my local grocer I see that infant
formula is also offered as a dry powder to be mixed by the parent.  I
could not come to a ready idea of how long the  formula powder might be
good on the shel f since it seemed to vary radically depending on exact
type and manufac turer.  The shortest use-by date was  only a year, but
some had use-by dates three years into the fut ure.  Clearl y, this is an
area that is going to need much investig ation.  I hope som e of our
knowledgeable readers out there will be able to help  out.

                               SPO ILAGE=======================================================================
A --  INSE CT INFESTATIONS
     A.1  PESTS OF STORED GRAINS, LEGUMES AND DRY FOODSTUF FS
     Insec t infestations can occur in a wide variety  of foodstuf fs such
as flours,  meals, pastas, dried fruits and veg etables, nuts, sweets,
whole grains, beans, sugars,  TVP, jerky, bird seed and pet  foods.
     Natur ally, the best way  to deal wit h an insect infestation is not
to have one in the fir st place.  Try to purchase from suppliers who are
clean and have a high volume of turnover  of their products .  This will
mean the product s you purchase will be less likely to have  bugs in them.
     When you buy food stuffs examine them closely to be sure the y are
insect free.  Check for any packaging or use by date s to insure their
freshness.  Don't shake the package, most adult insects will be found in
the top couple of inch es of the product and shaking the package will mix
them into the contents  and disguis e them.  If the package does turn out
to be infe sted, return it for repl acement.
     Once you have pur chased the product  you should store it in an air-
and moisture-tight container so it canno t be invaded  after you have
brought it home.   With sufficient time, adult and some lar val insect
forms can penetrate paper, cardboa rd and thin plastic packaging.  Your
containers should be either heavy plastic, glass or metal with tight
fitting lids.  As with  everything in food storage, you sho uld use olde r
packages before newer ones and ope ned packages  before unopened ones.
     The storage  area should be kept cle an.  Don't allow grain, flour,
beans, bits of pasta or othe r food particles to accu mulate on shelves or
the floor.  Cracks and crevices should be seal ed or otherwise blocked.
Unless it is a sticky spill, vacuuming is the best method of cleaning
since cleaning with soap and  water can wash food par ticles into the
cracks.
     Insec ts may get their start in chai rs, sofas and carp ets where food
is dropped  and not cle aned up.  Don't forget to repl ace the filt er bag
on the vac uum since some ins ects can sur vive and rep roduce in the bag
after they've been suc ked into it.
     Bags of dry pet food and bird  seed can also har bor insect
infestation.  Decorati ve foodstuffs such as ears of colorful Indian
corn, colored beans and hard  squashes can carr y insects that can  infest
your edible food.  Even poison baits can harbor flour beetles.
     A.2 CONTROL  OF INSECT INFESTA TIONS
     Shoul d you find that in spite  of buying fresh product s and using
careful packagin g techniques you have an insec t infestation, you can try
some of the foll owing steps:
    1.   If the food is too heavily infested to try to save it should be
         dispose d of as soon  as possible .  Remove it from the kitchen or
food storage area immediately so it won' t infest other foods.    2.   Large bugs can be sifted or winnowed out if the food's not too
         heavily  infested and you want to try to save it.  Then treat it
by placing  into a deep freezer at 0 deg. F for three to seven days
depending upon the siz e of the pac kage.  Refrigerator freezers usually
do not fre eze low enou gh to effectively kill all of the life sta ges of
insects, but if left there, will slow their developm ent.  If fre ezing is
not workable then the product could be spread on baking sheets and
heated to 150 deg. F for fif teen to twen ty minutes,  cooled and
repackaged. Heat treated foods should be consu med shortly thereafter.
    3.   The sur face areas where the foo d containers are stored can be
         treated  with an insecticide.  This is not a repla cement for
clean storage habits and goo d containers, but it can supplement it.
This will not control insect infestations already in your stored foods.
     Spray  the shelf surface  with 0.5% chlorpy rifos (Dursban), 1%
propoxur (Baygon ), 0.5 percent diazinon, or 0.25 per cent resmeth rin.
You can find any  of these in the hardwar e store in ready to appl y
packages.  If a spraye r isn't feasible then they can  be applied with a
paint brush.  Allow the solu tion to dry thoroughly.  Cover the shelves
with clean, untreated shelf paper and put prop erly package d foods back
on shelves .  READ THE PRODUCT LABEL FOR SAFETY INFORMATION CONCERNING
CHILDREN AND PET S.
     House hold bleach,  Lysol and other sterili zers will not cont rol
insect infestation, though they can be used for mold , mildew and algae.
     You may con tinue to find some insects after the cleanup is
finished.  This could be for several reasons.  The first being they
escaped from the  packages they wer e infesting and did not get cleaned
up.  There may be more  packages infested  than were origina lly realized
or, there may be hidin g places in the storage area that need att ention.
Once you have carefull y eliminated all food sources,  the bugs should
disappear in three to four weeks.
B -- MOLDS  IN FOOD
     Molds  are fungi just like mus hrooms and yeast.  Also like
mushrooms, they reproduce by relea sing spores into the air  that land on
everything, including your food and food  storage containers.  If those
spores begin to grow, they create thin threads  that spread through out
their growing medium.  These threads are the roots of the mold fungus,
called ""mycelium"".  The stal k of a mold fungus is the port ion above or
on the sur face of the food.  It produces  the spores and gives the mold
its color.  We've all seen example s of this when we discover a dish of
something or other left way-y-y too long  in the refr igerator and has
become covered in mold  fuzz.
     Molds  can grow anywhere  they have a growi ng medium (their food),
sufficient moisture and enou gh warmth.  Some can eve n grow at
refrigerator temperatures, albeit more slowly than they would if it were
warmer.  They can also  withstand much more sal t and sugar than bacteri a,
which is why you  sometimes find mold in jellies and jams with their high
sugar content and on cured product s like ham or baco n with their high
salt content.
     In the past , it was oft en felt a slight amount of mold was harmlessand the food cou ld be consumed anyway.  For molds that wer e
intentionally introduc ed into the food, such as the mold in bleu  cheese,
this is just fin e.  For the unintentional molds, it can be a ver y
serious error in judgm ent.  These unwanted molds might just be produci ng
a toxic substanc e called a ""mycoto xin"" which can be very bad ind eed.
Mycotoxins are produce d around the root or mycelium of the mold and the
mold roots can penetra te very deeply into the food.  These mycotoxins
can survive for a long time in foods, and unfo rtunately most are  not
destroyed by cooking.  The molds probabl y best known for this are the
various Aspergil lus varietie s which produces a mycot oxin known as
""aflatoxin"", but there are other dangero us molds as well, such as the
Fusarium molds.  Both of the above affect grain and some legumes .  See
B.3 Molds In Grains and Legu mes.
IMPORTANT NOTE:    In wet pack foo ds such as your home can ned goodies,
                   mol ds can do somethin g else as well, possibly  leading
to lethal consequences.  If they find their way into  wet pack acid foo ds
canned by the boiling water bath method,  whether by reasons of imprope r
procedure or contamination after the fac t, they can consume the natural
acids present in the food.  The effect of this  is to raise  the pH of the
food in the cont ainer, perhaps to the point that it becomes possible for
spores of *Clostridium botulinum*, better known as ""botuli sm"", to beco me
active and reproduce.  If you're not alr eady aware of the consequences
of botulis m poisoning, please read the bacteri al spoilage section below
where it has an entry all its own.   This is the most  deadly kind of food
poisoning there is.  For thi s reason, moldy wet pack  foods should be
*safely* discard ed.
     Molds  in low acid  foods canned by the pre ssure canning method are
equally dangerou s and should also be discarded in a safe manner.
     B.1  MINIMI ZING MOLDS
     You can do a number of things to minimize  unwanted mold gro wth in
your kitchen, food sto rage areas and ref rigerators.  If your kit chen is
at all lik e mine, it is the refrigerator that is going to collect the
most fungal growth.  This can be dealt with by washi ng the inside every
couple of months with a tablespoon of baking soda dissolve d in a quart
of warm water.  Rinse clean and allow to dry.  The black mildew that
grows on the rub ber door gas kets and oth er places can be dealt with by
wiping down with a solution of three tablespoons of household bleach in
a quart of water .  I general ly use a soft bristle brush for this .
     The rest of the kitchen  can be kept  mold free by keep ing it clean ,
and dry and by sprayin g occasionally with a product such as Lyso l.
Patches of mold growing in spots can be eliminated with the blea ch
solution used on the refrige rator doors.
     Try not to purchase more fresh food than you'll be able to eat in a
short period of time.  This will keep you from  having to deal with the
moldy remains that did n't get eate n.  If food does go mold y, don't sniff
it.  This is a good way to give yourself  respiratory difficulties if you
are at all susceptible to mold all ergies.  Moldy food should be disposed
in such a manner  that your animals  and childre n won't be able to get
into it.  Mycoto xins are eve ry bit as bad for your animals  as they are
for you.     Obvio usly, you don't have to throw out everythi ng that shows a spot
of mold on it.  Some foods can be safely dealt with and still partiall y
saved if they show sig ns of fungal growth.  Below is a set  of guidelin e
from M. Susan Brewer, Ph.D., R.D., a specialist in food safety.  Her
articles and wor ks are found in many sta te university extension services
publications lists.
    If the  food shows even a tiny mold spot, follow these guide lines:
1.  Hard or firm  foods with tiny mold spots can be trimmed ; cut away the
    area around the mold (at  least an inch) and rewr ap in clean wrap.
    Make sure that kni fe does not touch the mold.
2.  Soft foods such as chees e slices, cream cheese, sour cream and
    yogurt  should be thrown away.
          TOSS:
     Soft Cheeses, (Mozzarella, Brie, etc.)
     Sour Cream, Yogurt, Cottage cheese
     Bacon , Hot dogs, Sliced lunch meats
     Meat pies
     Opene d canned ham
     Most left-over food
     Bread , Cakes, rolls, flour, pastry
     Peanu t butter
     Juice s, berries
     Jam, Jellies, Syrups
     Cucum bers, Tomatoes
     Spina ch, Lettuce,  other leafy vegetables
     Banan as, Peaches,  Melons
     Corn- on-the-cob
     Store d nuts, whole grains, rice
          TRIM:
     Hard Cheese (Cheddar, Swiss, etc.)
     Bell Peppers, Carrots, Cabbage
     Brocc oli, Caulifl ower, Brussels Sprouts
     Garli c, Onions
     Potat oes, Turnips
     Zucch ini
     Apple s, Pears
     B.2  MOLDS IN CANNED GOODS
     If good equ ipment and proper technique are used , then it is
unlikely you wil l ever have mold growth in your unopened canned goods.
If you do have such, then there was eith er a flaw in the procedu re you
used, or somethi ng affected the jar or can aft er the fact to break its
seal.  In any event, once the food  has molded,  it is past saving and
should be discarded in such a way that childre n and animals will not be
able to get into  it.  The most lik ely home can ned products  to show mol d
growth are jams and jellies sealed with paraffin wax.    There are a number  of points in the canning process where this can
    occur:
    (1)  In the time after the jar  is taken out of its boi ling water
         bath, but bef ore it is filled.
    (2)  In the time between  when the jar is filled and covered with the
         melted wax.
    (3)  When the wax cools, if it pulls  away from the sid e of the jar ,
         leaving  an opening for the mold  to get in.
    (4)  If bubb les form in the paraffin , which break and leave holes.
     It is for this reason that most can ning authori ties no long er
recommend using this techniq ue.  If you must use it,  the jelly jars
should be boiled for at leas t 10 minutes  before the jelly is poured into
the jars.  The filled and wax capp ed jars should then be covered  with
some sort of protective lid.  The book, Putting Food By has exce llent
instructions on this or see the applicab le section of the
rec.food.preserving FAQ by Leslie Basel.
     B.3 MOLDS IN GRAI NS AND LEGUMES
     It's long been known that eat ing moldy grain is bad for you r
health.  The ugl y consequences of eating ergot-infected rye prob ably
make the best known example.   It's only been for abo ut thirty years,
though, that int ensive study of these grain fungi have bee n carried out
on other varieti es of molds and their respecti ve mycotoxins.
Fortunately, for those of us in the U.S. , the USDA and the  various state
departments of agricul ture go to a great  deal of trouble to dete ct grain
and legumes infected with these toxic fungi.  In som e of the les s
developed countries, the cit izenry are not so lucky.  Still, it is good
to have somethin g of an unde rstanding of what one should do to prevent
mold growth in one`s stored grains and to have  an idea of what to look
for and ask abou t when purchasing grains and legumes .
     The one fun gal type tha t has caused the most commotio n in recent
history are the various ""Aspergillus"" species of molds. Under certain
conditions with certain grains, legumes,  and to a lesser extent,  nuts,
they can produce  a mycotoxin called ""aflatoxin"".  This is a serious
problem in some parts of the world, most especially in peanuts,
occasionally in corn.  I am not aware of any documen ted deaths in the
United States from afl atoxicity, but oth er nations have not been  so
fortunate.  What makes aflatoxin so worr isome in this country is that it
is also a very potent carcinogen (cancer  causing agent).
     In addition  to the Aspe rgillus molds, there is also a very large
family of molds called ""Fusarium"" and these can prod uce a wide variety  of
mycotoxins, all of which you do not want  to be eatin g directly or
feeding to your food animals  where you will get the toxins back
indirectly when you eat them .
     The Federal  government and the vari ous state governme nts
continuously monitor food and fora ge crops.  Those product s which are
prone to mold growth and tox in production are not allowed to be sold for
food.  Once purchased however, it is up to you to keep you r food safefrom mold growth.  If you have alr eady found mold growth in your  whole
grains, meals, flours or other grain products, they should be discarde d.
Most mycotoxins are not brok en down or destroy ed by cooking temperatures
and there is no safe way to salvage grain that has molded.
     B.3.1  PREVENTING MOLD GROWTH IN STORED GRAINS AND LEG UMES
     The easiest  method to prevent  mold growth in your sto red grains and
legumes is simpl y to keep them too  dry for the  mold to grow.  The
Aspergillus and Fusarium molds require moistur e contents of 18% and
above to reprodu ce.  This is subje ct to some variabi lity, but in all
grains and soybeans, they must hav e a moisture  content of that level.
If you are  storing raw (not roasted) peanuts, in the shell or shelled,
you want to get the moisture  content to less than 8% as peanuts are
particularly susceptible to mold growth.   The recommended moisture
content for all other grain and legume storage  is no more than 10%.
*Please see part  2.A.3.1 Grains and Legu mes for a method to dete rmine
moisture content .*  At 10% moistur e, it is simply too dry for fungi to
grow.  *Please see 1.A .4 Storing Grains and Legumes for a suitab le
packaging technique.*
C -- BACTE RIAL SPOILAG E
     Just like the fun gi, bacteria  are everywh ere.  They'r e in the
water, soil, air, on you, your foo d and your food storage containers.
Fortunately, the vast majority of the bacteria  we encounte r are
relatively harmless or even benign and only a few represen t a danger to
us and our  stored foods.
     Bacte ria can be very much mor e difficult to kill off than molds and
insects.  Some of them  are capable  of continue d growth at temperatures
that would kill other spoilage organisms.  When conditions are such that
they are unable to grow, some bacteria can go dormant and form spores.
These spores can be quite hardy, even to the point of surv iving a
rolling boil.
     In order to grow,  bacteria need moi sture, some as little as a 20%
moisture content .  For dry grains,  legumes, powdered  milk and other low
moisture foodstu ff bacterial spoilage will sel dom be a pro blem so long
as the moi sture level in the foodstuff remains  too scant to supp ort its
growth.  For thi s reason, it is imperati ve that such products be drier
than 20% and pre ferably below 10% to ward off mold growth as well.  The
botulism bacteri um needs moisture in the 35% range to grow .  Thus,
making being sure of the moi sture content of the foo d products you wan t
to store, and appropri ately using desiccants in your  food packaging are
also excellent ideas.
WARNING: It is in wet pack canned goods (where the contain er has
         free liquid in it) and fresh foods we must be the most
concerned about spoilage bacteria.  It is here  that a little bad luck
and a moment's inatten tion to what  you are doi ng could kill or serious ly
injure you or some oth er person who eats  the foods you've put by.  In
both home-canned and commerc ially-canned goods, IF THE CAN  IS BULGING,
LEAKING, SMELLS BAD, OR SPEW S LIQUID WHEN YOU OPEN IT THEN  THROW IT OUT!
But, throw it out safe ly so that childre n and animals cannot get into
it.     C.1  BOTULI SM
     *Clos tridium botulinum* is one of the old est life for ms found on
the planet.  Like the gangrene bacteria, it is an anaerobi c organism
meaning it lives  and grows in the absence of free oxygen.  It forms
spores when conditions are not sui table for it to grow and  it is
commonly found in the soil.  This means it can be brought into your life
on raw pro duce, tools, hands or anything  else that came into con tact
with dirt.  To further  complicate matters, botulinum spores are
extremely heat-hardy.  The bacteri a itself can be killed by expo sing
them for a short  time to boiling water (212 deg. F AT SEA LEVEL
PRESSURE), but their spores can not.  To kill them, the food pro duct and
container must be expo sed to tempe ratures of 240 deg . F (AGAIN AT SEA
LEVEL PRESSURE) for a long enough period of time to allow all of the
food in each con tainer to come com pletely up to the proper temperature.
Only a pressure- canner can reach the necessar y temperature.
     It's not the bact eria or its spores which are directl y deadly, but
the toxin the bacteria  creates when it grows and rep roduces.  In its
pure form, botulism toxin is so potent that a mere teaspoo n of it woul d
be enough to provide a fatal  dose to hundreds of thousands of people.
It is this  lethality that is why every respons ible book on canni ng, food
preservation, food sto rage, and the like  hammers constantly on the nee d
for care in tech nique and method and why  spoilage must be taken so
seriously.
     C. botulinu m, like any other life form, must have sui table
conditions for it to grow and beco me a danger to you.  One of the
conditions it must hav e is a suita ble pH range  in its envi ronment.
pH is the measure of the aci dity or alka linity of a substa nce and is
measured on a scale of 1-14 with anythin g above 7 being consider ed
alkaline and eve rything below 7 being consider ed acid.  If the pH of
your wet pack food is BELOW 4.6 then bot ulism is unable to grow.   Keep
in mind pH is not eter nal in foods  and it is possibl e for it to change.
If it shou ld change to a les ser acidity than 4.6 pH your previou sly
botulinum proof food may sta rt allowing the lethal spoiler  to grow (se e
B.2, molds in canned goods).   This is why it is vita l to use pro per
technique, even for acid foo ds like tomatoes.  It has been  found that
when this occurs and botulin um becomes active and produces  its lethal
toxin it also produces  minute amounts of acid which can lower the pH of
the poisoned food back into what should have been the safe  zone had the
pH not jum ped up and allowed  the bacteri a to grow.  Again and again --
use good techniq ue and pay attenti on to what you are  doing.
     Botul inum toxin, unlike fungal mycotoxins, can be destroyed by
boiling the food  briskly in an open vessel for fifteen minutes.  Because
of this, if your  canned food shows any safety problems you should follow
this procedure.  If the food  shows even the slightes t mold growth, keep
in mind that myc otoxins are not for the most part broken down by heat
and dispose of the foo d safely.
     I don 't intend to go into the  hows of home canning here.  For tha t
I strongly  recommend that you read  the *r.f.p.  FAQ*, the *Ball Blue
Book* and most especia lly the book  *Putting Food By*  for in dept h
information on this subject.     C.2 OTHER BACTERI AL SPOILERS OF FOOD
     This section will be in a fut ure version of this FAQ.
D -- ENZYM ATIC ACTION IN FOOD SPOILAGE
     Every  living organism uses enzymes of many sorts in its bod ily
functions as part of its nor mal life cyc le.  Enzymes  are used in
creating life.  After death, enzymes play a role in the decompos ition of
once living tissue.  The enz ymes in a tomato help it to ripen and
enzymes produced  by the toma to and whatever fungal and bac terial
spoilers are on it cause it to decay.
     Fortu nately, slowing down or stopping the action of a food' s
enzymes is much easier to do than slowing or stoppin g some of the
bacterial spoilers mentioned above.  Enzymes are mos t active in a
temperature range between 85-120 deg. F and begin to be destroye d when
the temperature goes above 140 deg .F.  Cold also slo ws down the action
of enzymes , which is why fre sh tomatoes last longer in the refrigerator
than they do on the kitchen table.  Most enzymatic action also require s
moisture to occu r.  In foods  stored at 10% moi sture or less, there is
not enough moisture for most  enzymes to be active.

                      SPECIF IC EQUIPMENT QUESTIONS
=======================================================================
A -- STORA GE CONTAINERS
     A.1  WHAT IS FOOD  GRADE PACKAGING?
     Q:  OK, I'm  ready to start my stora ge program.  What should I put
         the foo d in?
     A:  You sho uld use food  grade packaging for sto ring anythin g you
intend to eat.  A food  grade container is one that will not tran sfer
noxious or toxic  substances into the foo d it is hold ing.  If you  are
uncertain whether a package type is food  grade you can con tact the
manufacturer.  Ask if that particu lar containe r is (US) FDA appr oved
meaning that it is safe for food use.  When inquirin g be sure to speci fy
the characteristics of the food you are storing; wet, dry, strongly
acidic or alkaline, alcoholi c or a high fat content.   A containe r that
is approve d for one of the above types of food  may not be approved for
another.
     The major functio ns of a food storage container are to:
    #1.  Protect  its content s from outside environmental influen ces such
    as moi sture, and oxygen,  but possibl y also heat or cold, light,
    insect s and/or rodents as well .
    #2.  Prevent  damage during handling and shipping .    #3.  Establi sh and/or maintain  microbiological stabili ty.  The
    contai ner should not all ow microorganisms such as fung i and bacteria
    from outside  the contain er to come into contact with its con tents.
    This is of critica l importance to wet-pack  foods such as canned
    vegeta bles, fruits and meats.
    #4.  Withsta nd the temperatures and pressures it will be exposed to.
    This is nece ssary if the contents are to be past eurized or
    steril ized, either immediately before or after filling .  It must not
    have any str uctural failures nor rel ease any nox ious or toxi c
    breakd own chemical s into the food it conta ins.  This is the reason
    why purpose built canning jars are recomme nded for hom e canning and
    mayonn aise jars aren't.  The former are made hea vier to with stand
    high tempera tures and handling  whereas the latter are not and have
    an inc reased risk of breakage if used for that purpose .
    Virtua lly all cont ainers used in home food preservation involving
exposure to high  temperatures are made of glas s or metal, with the
exception of some specialized ""heat & seal"" type of plastic bags.  Glass
can be used with any food type pro viding it is clean  and in soun d
condition, but metal cans are more  specialized.  They must be intended
for food use and  must also have a lining  or coating of the inside that
is suitabl e for the pH level  of the food  it will be in contact with.
    If the  foods are not sub jected to some for m of heat processi ng just
before or after packaging your sel ection of containe r types for home use
is a great  deal larger.  Virtually any kind of clean , sound glass jar
can be used and many types of new metal containers.  Several sorts of
plastics have become popular .  These various kinds of plas tics are eac h
suited for different purpose s, making selectio n a more com plex task.
     A.1.1   WHERE DO I FIND FOOD GRADE CONTAIN ERS?
    Food grade packagi ng is everywhere.  Every time you go into the
grocery store you are surrounded by it.  Many well known compani es such
as Tupperw are and Rubb ermaid manufacture and sell empty packagin g for
the express purpose of conta ining repackaged foods.  The kinds of
containers you are int erested in and the  types of foods you want  to put
in those contain ers will dic tate where you nee d to look for a particul ar
packaging system.
    For food sto rage purpose s most folks are usually  interested in five
and six gallon plastic  pails, glass jars from pint to gall on sizes,
metal containers such as the institutional sized #10 cans, and Mylar or
other high barrier property plastic bags.  Those are the contain ers most
often used, but virtually anything  that can protect foods from outside
environmental influenc es, safely contain  something you're going to later
eat and have a volume capacity large enough to be worthwhi le may be
used.
    A numb er of food storage  retailers such as those  listed in the
Resources section sell plastic buckets, Mylar bags and a few eve n sell
new #10 cans wit h lids.  It may also be possible to purchase #10 cans
through the LDS Family Canneries and dea lers such as Lehma n's Hardware
Cumberland General Store or Home Canning  Specialty and Sup ply.  On the
local scene, plastic five gallon buckets  are widely available, but onl y
if you pur chase them through  a restaurant or commerc ial foods supplyhouse will you likely be able to tell if they' re safe to keep food in.
If you can  locate a customer  service number for the manufacturer you can
call them and ask.  Many tim es manufacturers will make pro ducts that are
FDA approved and sell them as gene ral purpose containers, but you need
to call to be sure.
    Packag ing supply houses,  such as United States Plastic s and others,
have large FDA approve d packaging lines.  Several such com panies are
listed in the Resource s section and a bit of detecti ve work can probably
turn up more.  Some require minimum orders and others don't.  The cost
of shippin g the containers will probably  play a major role in your
decision making.   If you are  going to package a great deal of food all
at once, perhaps  for a group  of people, some of the companies that
require minimum purchases can some times save you a fair amount of mone y
and supply packaging you mig ht otherwise have a difficult time finding .
Some time spent searching the Thom as Register, available both online
(http://www12.thomasregister.com ) and in libr ary referenc e sections,
might turn up some val uable leads.
     For glass jars, don't overloo k flea markets, yard sal es, thrift
shops and similar places.  Canning  jars can sometime s be had for  very
little.  Delicat essens, sub shops and restaura nts of all sorts can be a
source of one gallon glass jars formerly  containing pickles, peppers,
etc.  If the lid s are still in good condition, they are well sui ted to
bulk storage and can be reus ed over and over.
    Metal cans, by and large, are not reusable  for good storage,  but
some companies might be able  to sell you  new cans.  The traditio nal
single use #10 can is only the beg inning of what mig ht be available with
a little looking .  Gallon sized or large r cans with double friction lids
(like paint comes in) make excelle nt storage contain ers and some
companies make them food saf e.  One gall on and larger cans with wide
diameter screw caps are avai lable from some companie s as well.  You
might have seen some of thes e holding edible oils, soy sau ce, honey and
other liquid food.  If they come with a cap that wil l seal air tight
they would be well sui ted for bulk  storage of grains and legumes ,
particularly if they come in a fou r to six gal lon size.
     Pick up you local phone book, log on to your favorite  search engine
or head to your local public, college or unive rsity library and explore
the possibilities.  Make it clear that what you want  must be FDA
approved and be up front about how many you need or can deal wit h.  If
one company won't deal with you, try ano ther. You'll eventually get what
you want.

     A.2  PLASTI C PACKAGING
     Befor e we can int elligibly discuss plastic packaging it is
necessary to understand what the substan ce we call ""plasti c"" is.
Plastics are pro duced from basic polymer s called ""resins"", each of which
have differing physica l properties.  Additives may be blen ded in to
color them or to modif y particular properties such as mold ability,
structural properties, resistance to light or heat or oxid ation.
Additionally, it is common for sev eral differe nt kinds of plastic to be
laminated together each performing a particular desired task.  One mig ht
offer structural rigidity and the other might be more impermeable to the
transfer of gass es and odors.  When bonded together a rigid, gas
impermeable package can be made.
     Wheth er that package is safe for food use  will depend on the exac t
nature of the additive s blended into the  plastic.  Some of them,  notably
plasticizers and dyes, can migrate  from the packagin g material into the
food it's containing.  This may be exace rbated by the natu re of the food
it's in contact with especia lly if it is high fat, strongl y acidic or
alcoholic in particular.  Time and  temperature may also play a promine nt
role in the migr ation of plastic additiv es into food.  For this reason,
the (US) FDA ass esses the safety of pack aging materials for food  contactand conducts toxicological studies  to establis h safety standards.  Only
plastics that are FDA approved for a particular food type should be used
for direct contact with that food.
     Just being FDA approved , however, may not  be all of the sto ry.  It
must still be determin ed whether the par ticular plastic in quest ion has
the physical properties that would make it desirable for your purpose.
     As mentione d above each base resin has somewhat  differing physica l
properties that may be modif ied with add itives or combined  by laminati ng
with another plastic or even  completely unrelated material s such as
metal foils.  An examp le of this is ""Myl ar"", a type of polyester film.
By itself,  it has mode rate barrier  resistance to moisture and oxygen.
When laminated togethe r with aluminum foil it has very hig h resistance
and makes an excellent material for crea ting long term foo d storage
packaging.  One or more other kinds of plastic  with low melting points
and good flow characte ristics are typically bonded on the opposite side
of the foi l to act as a sealant ply so that the alum inized Mylar can be
fashioned into bags or seale d across container openings. The com bined
materials have propert ies that mak e them useful for long term storage
that each separately do not have.
     Proba bly the most  common plastic that rai ses suitabil ity question s
is High Density PolyEthylene (HDPE).  It's use d in a wide array of
packaging and is the materia l that most plastic five and six gal lon
buckets are made  of.  It has  a moderate rigidity, a good resista nce to
fats, oils, moisture and imp acts, a fair resistance to acids, but is a
poor barrier to oxygen.
     Wheth er it is suitable for your pur pose depends  on how sens itive to
oxygen exposure your product  is and how long you nee d it to stay  in
optimal conditio n.  Foods such as whole grains are not par ticularly
delicate in natu re and will easily keep for years in nothi ng more than a
tightly sealed HDPE bucket.  Most legumes are the same way , but those
that have high fat con tents such as pean uts and soyb eans are mor e
sensitive to O2.  Other foods such as dry milk  powder might only go a
year before deleterious changes are noti ced.  If tha t milk were sealed
in an air- tight aluminized Mylar bag wit h the oxygen inside removed, the
milk would probably go for two yea rs or more.  Better still would be to
seal the milk in a met al can or glass jar.  HDPE can  still be used for
long term storage, but with one or more of the following precaut ions to
keep a high food quality:  The foo d should either be put on a shorter
rotation cycle than packagin g also using a second gas barr ier such as
Mylar; be periodically opened and re-purged or fresh  absorbers should be
inserted.
     Some special plastics and pla stic laminat es have excellent oxygen
and moisture barrier propert ies and are eminently suited to long  term
storage, but for  home use they are  not easy to find,  though some used
containers might be availabl e for reuse..
     A.2.1   HOW DO I GET THE  ODOR OUT OF PICKL E BUCKETS?
     I've had fairly good luck doi ng it in the following way.  Since
vinegar is the primary  smell in pickles and it's aci dic, we used  a base
to counter act it.  Fir st we scrubbed the bucket well, inside and out,
with Dawn dish deterge nt.  Most any sort  will do.  Then we fille d thebuckets with hot  water and dissolv ed a cup of baking soda in each.  Stir
well, get the bucket as full  as you can and put the top on.  Put  the
bucket in the sun to keep it warm so the plastic pores stay open as much
as possibl e.  In a cou ple of days come back and empt y the buckets.
Rinse them out, fill with warm wat er again and add about a cup of blea ch
and reseal.  Put back in the sun for ano ther couple of days.  Empty out
and let dry with  the tops off.  We compl etely eliminated the vin egar
smell this way.  It might be possi ble to cut the tim e down a lot, but we
haven't experime nted that much sin ce we can't get that man y pickle
buckets.
     A.3  METAL CANS
     Metal  cans and glass jars bei ng heat resistant, can both be used
for heat process ed, wet-pack  foods and for non -heat treated dry pack
canning.  For wet food s, however, metal cans have several disadvantages
for the do-it-yourself er.  They are hard  to come by,  and they take
specialized equipment to use that can be diffi cult to loca te.  Probabl y
the greatest flaw which makes them unpopular for hom e canning heat
processed wet-pack foo d is that they can  only be used once.  Since the
commercial canning industry is not interested in reusing the con tainers,
metal cans make great sense for their purposes .  The cans are both
cheaper (for the m) and lighter than glass jars.  This adds to the
economy of scale  that makes canned foods as cheap as they are in the
grocery store.
     For home canning,  wet-pack heat pro cessed foods glass jars are
better because even the smal lest of town s will usually have at least one
business that carries pressure and boiling water canners along with
jars, rings and lids.  With metal cans a can sealer is necessary and
this usually has to be order ed from the manufacturer or a mail-order
distributor.  A few of which  are listed in the Resources section .
     Metal  cans are not real ly made entirely of tin.   They're actually
steel cans with a tin coating on the ins ide and outs ide.  Some kinds of
strongly colored  acidic foods will fade in color from long exposure to
tin so a type of ename l liner called ""R- enamel"" is used to fore stall
this.  Certain other kinds of food  that are high in sulfur or that are
close to neutral  in pH will also discolo r from prolonged contact  with
tin.  For those foods, cans with ""C-enam el"" are used .
     The excelle nt food preservation book, *Putting Food By* Cha pter 6
(see reference list) has a section  on the use of metal cans for wet
packed foods.
     It is in dry-pack  canning that metal cans for home use begi n to
come into their own.  Becaus e microbiological sterilization isn't
necessary, foods that are dry pack ed into containers do not have  to be
subjected to heat processing nor does the safe ty of their seals depend
upon the vacuum that the coo ling content s create.  This means that oth er
packaging methods and container types may be used.
     Proba bly the most  common use of metal containers is the #10  cans
such as are used  by the LDS family canneries discuss ed below. This is
not the only way  they may be used though.  It will probabl y take a bit
of searchi ng, but ther e are various food grade metal containers
available of sufficient volume to make them useful for foo d storage.They usually have double friction lids similar  to paint cans or screw
caps like jars that can achi eve an air-tight seal.  If you  can find them
in a large  enough volume capacity they can be of real use for storing
bulky foods such as grains, legumes and sugar.  Smaller cans of a gallon
or less would be usefu l for storing items like dry milks.  If properly
sealed, metal cans hav e a far high er barrier resista nce to gasse s such
as oxygen,  CO2, and nitrogen  than any plastic.
     Altho ugh they can  hardly be conside red portable  the use of metal
drums (not garbage or trash cans), either themselves food grade or used
with food grade liners, is also a possib ility.  A fifty five gal lon drum
full of grain will wei gh several hundred  pounds, but may make for a much
easier storage solutio n than multiple buckets.   The advantage of using
such a large container is that a great amount of a single product can be
kept in a smalle r amount of space and fumigati ng or purging the storage
atmosphere would be simpler.   The disadvantages are the difficul ties of
moving it and rotating  the stock in the drum.  If using oxygen absorbe rs
make sure the drum you  want to use is capable of making an air-tight
seal, otherwise you should stick with carbon dioxide  fumigation.
     A.3.1   POOLING RESOURCE S:  THE CHUR CH OF JESUS CHRIST OF
     LATTE R DAY SAINTS -- THE MORM ONS
     Altho ugh the purc hase of a can seal er and metal cans for home use
is not eco nomically feasible  for most people there is one way that it
can be.  This is by pooling community resource s to purchas e the
equipment and supplies .  It may even, in fact,  not be nece ssary to form
your own communi ty to do this.  If you live in the right area your loc al
Latter Day Saints church may have facilities they will all ow you to use.
They may even have sui table food product s to sell you.  This is an
offshoot of the church's welfare program s and it is done in thei r family
canneries.  Rather than using plastic buckets they have gone ove r to
using metal cans church-wide for dry-pac k canning.  By sha ring the cos t
of the equ ipment and purchas ing the cans  in bulk qua ntities, they are
able to enjoy the adva ntages of metal cans ove r plastic containe rs while
minimizing the disadva ntages of cost.  As we approac h the end of the
Millennium, other groups, both rel igious and secular , are purchasing can
sealers in order  to facilita te their own food storage programs as well .
    *Pleas e see VI.F.1 Organizations.  The Chu rch of Jesus  Christ of
Latter Day Saints -- LDS Fam ily Cannerie s for more detaile d information
about where LDS Family Canneries may be found and how best  to approach
using them.*
     Any food products  you want to have sealed in cans wil l need to fall
within the LDS cannery  guidelines of suitability for that type of
packaging.  This is for reas ons of spoil age control since many types of
foods just aren't suitable for jus t sealing in a con tainer without
further processi ng.  If you purchase food products from them, they wil l
already be withi n those guidelines. *A brief treatme nt of these
guidelines may be foun d in VI.F.1 LDS Family Canneri es Guidelines.*
     Once you have you r foodstuffs on hand, either supplyi ng your own or
by purchas ing them fro m the cannery you're ready to package them.  It is
here that using some foretho ught concern ing your pac kaging system can
save you much time and  aggravation.  With the Millennium coming upon us
the traffic load of the cann eries is really beginnin g to pick up.  Thi smeans that access time to the can sealers and other equipment may be
limited.
IMPORTANT NOTE:    Please do keep in mind that the individ uals
                   res ponsible for the family canneries are all
*volunteers* with demands on their  time from many areas.  Be cou rteous
when speaking with the m and, if there are faci lities for use, flexible
in making arrangements to use them .  You will, of course, have to pay
for the supplies  that you use, can s and lids at the least, and any foo d
products you get  from them.  With the onset of the millenn ium the LDS
family cannery volunte ers are beco ming quite busy so be prepared  to have
to work with the ir available scheduling.  As a gener al rule they cannot
put your food in stora ge for you.  Be ready to pay for you r purchases in
advance, if nece ssary.  They do not take  credit cards and probably
cannot make change so take a check  along with you.
     The followi ng is a list of suggesti ons to make the most eff icient
use of your access time:
    #1 - Make your app ointment well in advance .  Many people are
         beginni ng to make use of the cannerie s so making advanced
         reserva tions is a must.
    #2 - Have enough people to set up an assem bly line typ e operation.
         Make sure eac h of your people knows what they nee d to do and
         how to do it.  At least four people for any  serious amount of
         food is a goo d number.  Ask the  cannery volunteer to go over
         the pro cess with you and your crew.
    #3 - Make sure you  have enough muscular helpers to do the heavy
         lifting  so you don' t wear yourself out or hurt your bac k.  Some
         of the supplies you will be working with, such as wheat , come
         in fift y pound bags and a box of #10 cans full of sugar  or
         other weighty  items are heavy.
    #4 - Make labels for the  foods you are goi ng to pack in adva nce.
         This will sav e time after the cans are fill ed.
    #5 - Take out only  as many as oxygen absorbers as you can seal up in
         a half hour.  They use up most of their capacity within two to
         three hours dependi ng on temperature and humidity .  You don't
         want them to waste any by soaki ng up the oxygen in the room.
         The one s you don't use up right  away should be tightly sealed
         in a gas proo f container.
    #6 - Save powdery food items such as dry milk powder, pudding mixes
         and gra in flours and meal s till last.  They can be mess y to can
         and thi s will keep them out of your other foods.
    #7 - Leave time to clean  up after yourself .  They are doing you the
         courtes y of using their equipme nt and selling you the supplie s
         at cost .  You should return the favor by leaving the place at
         least as clea n as you fou nd it.
    #8 - Always keep in the back of your  mind just how muc h volume and
         weight your vehicle  can carry.  You'd hate to find you canned
         more than you  could carry home.     *See also IV.C.2 Preventing Corrosi on of Canned Goods.*
     A.4  GLASS JARS
     Compa red to metal  cans, glass jars are very sta ble, althoug h they
obviously don't take being banged around very well.  The cardboa rd boxes
most jars come in are well designe d to cushion  them from shocks.   The
box also has the  added bonus of keeping damaging light away from food.
     The major advanta ge of glass jars is that  they are reusable . For
wet-pack canning  the lids must be replaced, but the rings don't.  For
dry pack canning  even the lids may  be reused probabl y indefinitely.
     When you get righ t down to the bott om line, it is seldom practica l
strictly in term s of dollars  and cents to wet- pack your own food  in
jars.  When you count the cost of your equipme nt, includin g the jars,
rings, lids and all the rest , along with a not inconsiderable amount of
your personal time, the cost  of purchasi ng or growing your produce,
you'll almost always come out ahea d to buy foo d canned for you by the
commercial canning industry.  That said, forget about the strict bottom
line and examine  more closely why you want to put up your own food.  For
many, gardening is a pleasur e and they have to have something to do with
the food they've  grown!  There's also the fact  that for many, you simp ly
cannot buy the quality  of the food  you can put  up for your self.  The
canning industry  tries to appeal to a broad spectrum  of the gene ral
public while you can put up food to your  own family' s specific tastes.
Home canning is not so much about saving money as it is about
satisfaction.  You get  what you pay for.
     If home can ning appeals  to you, ple ase allow me to point you towa rd
the *rec.food.preserving FAQ* where much very good informa tion about
methods and tech niques may be foun d.
     Dry-pack canning using glass jars, on the other hand, may well make
a great deal of economic sense.  It is usually  far cheaper  per pound to
purchase food in bulk quantities, but often unsuitab le to store it that
way.  Breaking the foo d down into smaller units allows for easier
handling and exp oses a small er quantity of food to oxygen and moisture
before it can be used up.  Of cour se, packagin g used for doing this can
be made of many different material s, but glass is often the easi est and
most convenient to acquire and use .  Used containers are frequen tly
suitable and are  often free or of little cost.  One source of gallon
sized glass jars are sandwic h shops and restaurants that use pic kles,
peppers and othe r sandwich condime nts.  I have  a Subway sandwich  shop
that saves its pepper jars for me and receive several per week.  There
are also half-gallon canning  jars, though they are sometim es difficult
to find.  The brand I buy is made by Kerr.
     A.5   MYLAR  BAGS
     The word ""Mylar"" is a tradema rk of the DuPont corpora tion for a
special type of polyester film.  Typical ly made in thin sheets, it has a
high tensile strength and is used in a wide variety of industrial
settings.     In food sto rage, particularly for the lon g term, it is comm only
found as a lamin ate with Myl ar as the top laye r, a very thin alu minum
foil in the midd le and one or more  other types of plastic films on the
bottom acting as seala nt plies.  This laminate  combination possesses a
high resistance to the passage of oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen,
other gasses and water vapor and is what  makes it valuable  for our
purposes.  Unfortunately, it has a poor puncture resistance so it must
be used as an interior  liner for more puncture  resistant contain ers
rather than as a stand - alone package.
     Food grade aluminized Mylar complie s with US FDA requ irements and
is safe to be in conta ct with all food types except alcoholic.
     For food use, Myl ar is most commonl y available as pre-made bags of
various sizes.  Flat sheets or rolls of the material  might also be found
from which bags could be fashioned as well.
     When Mylar bags are use d by the sto rage food industry  they are
generally for products  sealed in plastic  buckets.  The rea son for doin g
this is that the  High Density PolyEthylene (HDPE) from whi ch the pails
are made is some what porous to gasses.  This means that small molecule s,
such as oxygen (O2), can slo wly pass thr ough the pla stic and com e into
contact with the  food inside.  The problem is further compounded if
oxygen absorbers are used, as the result of their absorbin g action is to
lower the air pressure  inside the container unless it has first been
carefully flushed with an inert gas such  as nitrogen .  How fast this
migration activity will occur is a funct ion of the specifi c plastic
formulation, its wall thickness and the air pressure  inside the
container.  In order to gain  the maximum  possible shelf life a second
gas barrier, the Mylar bag, is used inside the pail.
     Wheth er the use of thes e bags is necessar y for your home packaged
storage foods depends on how oxygen sensitive the food ite m is and how
long you want it to stay fre sh.  If the container is made of a gas
impervious material such as metal or glass then a second gas bar rier
inside is not needed.  If it is HDPE or a plastic with sim ilar
properties and you wan t to get the  very longest possible storage  life
(say 10+ yrs for  grain) then Mylar is a good idea.  If you 're going to
rotate that grain in four to five years or less then it is not needed.
Provided the oxy gen has been  purged from the contain er in the first
place, either with a proper flushing technique, or by abso rption, there
will not have been suf ficient O2 infiltr ation to seriously impact the
food.  Particularly oxygen sensiti ve foods such as dry mil k powders that
are to be kept in plas tic containe rs for more than two yea rs would
benefit from the  use of Myla r.  Naturall y, storage tempera ture and
moisture content  is going to play a major role as well.
     There  is also the  question of the seal integrit y of the out er
container.  If you are  using thin walled plastic buckets in conj unction
with oxygen absorbers the resultin g drop in air pres sure inside the pail
may cause the walls to buckl e.  If this should occur, there would be a
risk of losing seal integrit y, particularly if the buckets  are stacked
two or more deep.  If the food was  packed in Mylar bags with the
absorbers inside this would keep the vac uum from ser iously stressing the
container walls.  Better still would be not to have the problem at all
by either using containers of suff icient wall thickness or flush ing with
inert gas before sealing.  Wall thicknes s is one rea son why the six
gallon SuperPails have become so widespr ead.  It sho uld be noted  thatMylar is not str ongly resistant to insec t penetration and not resistan t
at all to rodents.  If mice chew through  your buckets, they'll go righ t
through the bags .
     A num ber of retai l dealers carry Mylar bags.  Contact  information
may be found in the supplier s section.
     A.5.1   HOW DO I USE  MYLAR BAGS?
     Seali ng food in Mylar bags is a str aight-forward affair, but it may
take a bit of practice  to get it right, so purchase one or two more bags
than you think you'll need in case  you don't immedia tely get the  hang of
it.
    #1 - The bag s typically sold by stor age food dea lers look rather
         large when you comp are them to the five or six gallons buckets
         they are comm only used in.  Tha t extra material is very
         necessa ry if you are to have enough bag lef t over after filling
         to be able to work with it.  Unless you are  very sure of what
         you are  doing, don't trim off any mat erial.
    #2 - Place the bag  inside the outer container and fill  with the food
         product .  Resist filling it all the way to the top.  You need
         at leas t an inch or so below the buck et rim left open to get
         the lid  to seat com pletely.
    #3 - When it seems  to be full,  gently thump the pail on the floor a
         few tim es to pack the pro duct in and reduce air pockets . Add
         any mak eup food nec essary to bring level back to where it
         should be.
    #4 - Take the bag by the corners and pull out any slac k in the
         materia l so that all side s can be pulled together  evenly.
         Place your oxygen absorbe rs inside if you are goi ng to use
         them.  Now place a board over the top  of the buck et and fold
         the bag  end down over it keeping it straigh t and even.  Place a
         piece of thin  cotton fabric such as sheet or t-shirt material
         over the edge  of the bag mouth.  Using a clothes iron set on
         the cot ton, wool or high setting run it over the cloth-covered
         Mylar about a half- inch from the edge  for about twenty seconds
         or so until it seal s.  You'll probabl y have to do the bag in
         section s.  Experime nting on a left-over str ip to find the rig ht
         tempera ture setting  is a good idea.
    #5 - When you've done the enti re mouth of the bag allo w it to cool .
         Once cool try  to pull the  mouth of the bag open.  If it doesn 't
         come open, fold the  bag down into the  pail until you feel the
         trapped  air pillowi ng up firmly against the material and wait
         to see if it deflates.  If it doesn't , then your seal is good .
         You can  seal on the bucket lid at this point or take the
         further  step to vacuum or gas flush the bag .
     Once a seal has been obtained  the bags can be left as-is, vacuum
sealed or gas flushed.   To obtain the most eff icient oxygen removal the
bags can be firs t drawn down with a vacuum pump and then purged using an
inert gas.     VACUU M SEALING MYLAR BAGS
     Once you have obt ained a good seal on the bag, pulling a vacuum on
the contents is also pretty straight forward.
     First  you'll need something to make  a vacuum with.  This can be
either a regular  vacuum pump, a vacuum sealer such as the Tilia Food
Saver or even the suct ion end of your househol d vacuum cleaner.  The end
that is to be inserted  into the bag will  need to be of fairly small
diameter in orde r to keep the hole  in the Myla r from being any larger
than necessary.  This means that if you use a vacuum  cleaner you'll need
to fashion  some form of redu ction fitting.
     Cut a hole into the Myl ar bag on a corner , making the opening only
just large enough to admit the vac uum probe.  Insert  the nozzle and
using a sponge, or something similar, push dow n on the mat erial over the
probe to make a seal.  Now draw down a vacuum on the bag.  It will
probably only take a second or two.  When it's drawn down as much as
possible, run a hot iron dia gonally across the cut corner resealing the
bag.
     GAS FLUSHIN G MYLAR BAGS.
     Flush ing with ine rt gas works essentially just like vacuum sealing
except that you're putting more gas into  the bag rat her than tak ing it
out.  You'll want to keep the entr y hole small, but don't make a seal
around it as above.  Beyond that, follow the directi ons as given  in
Section IV.B.2 - CO2 and Nit rogen.  When you feel that the  bag has bee n
sufficiently flushed, run the iron  across the corner just as above to
seal.
     Flush ing with dry  ice can als o be done, but it is important to wait
until the frozen carbon dioxide has comp letely sublimated into gas
before making the fina l seal otherwise the bag  will burst like an
overfilled balloon.
                  
     A.6  REUSIN G OR RECYCLI NG PACKAGING
     In an effor t to save money or becau se new packaging may be hard to
come by, it is common for many peo ple to want to re-use previous ly used
containers.  There is nothing wrong with this, but it is sometim es more
complicated than just using new containe rs would be.  Here are some
general ""rules of thum b"" that can be used if you hav e an interes t in
doing this.
     #1.  Do not  use contain ers that hav e previously contained
     produ cts other than foo d.  There are two risks this can
     expos e you to.  The fir st is that the par ticular package type
     may not hav e been tested for food use and  may allow the
     trans fer of chemi cals from the pack aging into your food.  The
     secon d is that all plas tics are por ous to some degree.  Small
     amoun ts of the previous  contents may have  been absorbed by
     the packagi ng material only to be release d into your food,
     parti cularly if it is wet, oily or alcoholic.     #2.  Previo usly used containe rs should only be used with
     foods  of a simila r nature and exposed to similar processes.
     This means that if a containe r previously held a material
     high in fat, such as cooking oil, then it shoul d not be used
     to store a strong  acid such as vine gar.  Nor should a
     conta iner be expo sed to extre me conditions, such as heat, if
     the origina l use of the package did not subject  it to that
     treat ment.  An exceptio n to this is glass  which is covered
     below .  Generally speaking, dry, non-oily , non-acidic or
     alkal ine, non-alc oholic foods may be safe ly contained in any
     food safe contain er.  An exam ple of this is keeping grains
     and legumes  in HDPE buc kets formerl y containing pickles.
     #3.  Glass may be used to store any food provided it is in
     sound  condition and has  only been used to store  food
     previ ously.  The lid or cap, however, that seals the jar is
     subje ct to the cautions  given above.  Glass jars not
     speci fically made for home canning,  either boiling water bath
     or pressure  canning, have a signifi cant risk of break age if
     used for that pur pose.
     #4.  Porous  packaging materia ls such as paper, cardboard and
     Styro foam should not be reuse d.  Their open tex ture can tra p
     food particles and are very difficu lt to adequately clean.
     Packa ging formerl y holding raw meat s or shelled  egg product s
     are particu larly at risk.
     #5.  Contai ners previou sly holding odorous foods may trap
     those  odors and transfe r them to foods later stored.  Trust
     me, pickle flavored milk leaves a lot to be desired.  Foods
     such as dry milk powders, fats and oils, flours and meals
     will absorb any odors seeping  from your contain er material.
     Be sure to get the smel l out before you fill them.
B -- CO2 AND NIT ROGEN
     Carbo n dioxide (CO2) and nitr ogen (N2) are comm only used in
packaging both fresh and she lf-stable foods, in orde r to extend their
usable shelf lives.  Fresh foods are out side the sco pe of this work so
attention shall be focused only on those  foods suitable for use in
storage programs .
     The most common use of these gasses is for excl uding oxygen (O2)
from the atmosph ere containe d inside of a storage containe r (called head
gas).  When oxygen levels can be dropped  below 2% the amou nt of
deleterious oxidation reactions in store d foods can be greatly decreas ed
resulting in longer palatabi lity and nut ritional shelf lives.  Actuall y
achieving this low oxy gen content is not a simple matter when limited to
the equipment and faci lities typically availab le in the home.  With
careful techniqu e and proper packaging materia ls it is possible to
achieve useful results  though.
     In order for eith er gas to be used most effecti vely to gain  the
longest possible  shelf life it is recommended that it be contain ed
inside of packaging with hig h barrier properti es to prevent it fromdiffusing out over tim e or allowin g oxygen to infuse in.  Exampl es of
this kind of packaging are Mylar and oth er high barrier property
plastics, metal cans and gla ss jars.  Buckets made of HDPE  plastic are
poor gas barrier s and will, over time, allow oxygen to infuse into the
container.  In order for foo ds to be kept for their maximum shelf lives
the containers would need to be re-purge d every three to four years.
Foods that are particu larly oxygen sensitive, such as dry milk powders ,
should not be stored in HDPE  without a seconda ry gas barrier.  It is
possible to use HDPE buckets  alone when gas purging if a shorter
rotation period is used.  An examp le would be using wheat in four to
five years instead of the eight to ten that would be achie vable if a
high barrier container were used.
     Purgi ng efficiency can be greatly improve d when used with a vacuu m
device.  By firs t drawing down the  head gas of the contain er and then
flooding with the purg ing gas much  more oxygen can be remo ved from the
container.  Repeating the process once more will imp rove removal
efficiency even more.  If a true vacuum pump is not available, the
suction end of a home vacuum-cleaner can be made to serve and still
achieve useful results .  With careful techniqu e, oxygen levels can be
dropped to be 0.5-2%.  Finely textured materia ls such as grain flours
and meals, dry milk powders and similar textured foods will purge poorly
and are better package d with oxygen absorbers.  Instructions for vacuum
usage are given in *A.5.1 Using Mylar Bags.*  Instru ctions for gas
purging are give n below in *B.1 Dry Ice and B.2 Comp ressed Nitrogen*.
     A les s common, but impo rtant use for carb on dioxide is fumi gation.
This is the kill ing or retar ding of inse ct life contained in a product .
Many chemical fumigant s are available to do this but  are not tho ught
desirable by many who have foodstu ffs they wan t to put int o storage.
CO2 is not as certain as the more toxic fumigants, but it can be made to
work and will not leav e potentially harmful residues  behind.  It is
possible for nit rogen to work in a simil ar manner, but it must be in a
head gas concent ration of 99%+ whe reas carbon dioxide can be effective
over time at levels as low as 3%.  The precise  amount of time necessar y
for the gas to do its work will vary acc ording to the spec ific species
and growth stage of the inse ct along with the temperature and humidity
level of the pro duct being fumigat ed.  In gene ral, the mor e active the
growth stage and the warmer the temperat ure the more  effective CO2 is in
killing weevil infesta tions.  The gas also exh ibits bacterial and fung al
inhibiting properties, but for our  purposes this wil l be of litt le
moment since all foods should be too dry  to support such growth in the
first place.
     The procedu re for fumigating foodstuffs with carbon dioxide  is
precisely the same as the one used  in purging oxygen from storage
containers mentioned below.  The only change is that  for the fas test
effectiveness the seal ed container should be left in a war m place for a
week or so befor e moving it into its fin al storage locatio n.  The gas is
still effective at cooler temperat ures, but because insect life is
slowed by lower temperatures the carbon dioxide takes longer to complete
its mission.
NOTE:    Both Mitsubis hi Gas-Chemical, maker of the Ageless line of
         oxygen absorbers, and Mul tisorb, manufacturer of the FreshPax  D
750 absorbers, state the the ir products should not be used  in a high
carbon dioxide head gas envi ronment.     B.1  DRY ICE
     Using  dry ice to displace oxygen from foo d storage containe rs is a
very straightforward affair.   To get the  best purging results it is
recommended that all foodstu ffs and pack aging materials be put in a warm
location for a few hou rs before beginnin g the purging process.  The
reason for this is that the cold CO2 sub limating from the dry ice will
be denser than the war mer, lighter  oxygen containing air.  The cold gas
will tend to stay on the bot tom, gradual ly filling the con tainer and
pushing the warm  air out of the top.
     When you first pick you r dry ice up from the supplier , put it in a
moisture proof contain er so that water vapor will be less able to
condense and fre eze on it.  The sublimat ing gas will  prevent you from
being able to tightly seal it, but  you can slo w down any water ice
accumulation.
     Assem ble the cont ainer and any inte rior packagi ng materials.  Break
off a piece of dry ice  of sufficie nt size for the volume to be purged.
One pound of dry ice will produce about 8.3 cubic feet of carbon dioxide
gas so approximately four ounces per fiv e gallon bucket will do.   Wipe
off any accumula ted water frost which should look whiter than the
somewhat bluish frozen gas.  Wrap in a paper towel to keep  foodstuffs
out of direct contact.   Place in the bot tom of the contain er that will
actually contain  the food, i.e. the bag.   Fill the package  with the food
product, shaking  and vibrati ng while doing so to achieve the max imum
packing density.
     If a vacuum  process is not to be used the n place the lid on the
container, but do not fully seal.  If a liner bag is being  used then
gather the top togethe r or heat seal and  cut off a small corner.   This
is to allo w the air being purged to esca pe as it is pushed upward by the
expanding gas from the  dry ice.  Do not move or shak e the container
while the ice is subli mating so as to minimize  turbulence and mixing.
After approximately two hour s complete the sea l.  Check the cont ainer
every fifteen minutes or so to be sure that a pressu re build up is not
occurring.  A small amount of posi tive pressur e is OK, but  do not allo w
to bulge.
     If a vacuum  process is used then cut off a corner of the bag and
insert the probe or place the cont ainer in the vacuum chamber.  Draw a
vacuum and when it has reached the desired point shut it off, but do not
allow air to get back inside.  When the dry ice has finished sublimating
seal the contain er.  If a slightly  larger piece of dry ice  is used thi s
process may be repeate d once more to improve oxygen removal.  Watch for
pressure signs as abov e.
NOTE:    It is natural  for some grains and leg umes to adso rb carbon
         dioxide  when stored in a atmosp here with high lev els of the
gas.  This will result in a drop in head  space air pressur e much like
using oxygen absorbers will cause as they absorb oxygen.  Precau tions
should be taken in thin walled containers against buckling  and possibl e
loss of seal int egrity.  When the food product s are removed from the
container they will release the adsorbed  CO2 and suf fer no harm.
WARNING: Dry ice  (frozen carbon dioxide)  is extremel y cold and can cau se
         burns to the skin by mere ly touching it.  Because  of this youshould wear gloves whenever handling it.  Also, dry ice evaporat es into
carbon dioxide gas, which is why we want  it.  CO2 is not inheren tly
dangerous, we breath it out with every breath we take, but you should
make sure the area you  are packing  your storage containers in is
adequately ventilated so the escaping gas will  not build to a level
dangerous enough to asphyxia te you.
IMPORTANT NOTE:    Because dry ice  is very col d, if there is much
                   moi sture in the air trapped  in the cont ainer with it,
and your food, it will  condense.  Try to pack your contain ers on a day
when the relativ e humidity is low or in an area with low humidit y, such
as in an air-con ditioned house.  Use of a desiccant package when using
dry ice to purge  storage containers may be a good idea.
     B.1.1   DRY ICE SUPPLIER S
     Dry ice may  be found at ice houses,  welding supply shops, some ice
cream stores, meat pac kers or you could look in your  local phone book
under the headings ""dry ice"" or ""gasses"" .
     B.2  COMPRE SSED NITROGE N
     B.2.1   TYPES OF AVAILAB ILITY
     Both nitrogen (N2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are commonly availabl e
in the for m of compres sed gas in cylinde rs.  In food  storage, CO2 is
mainly used in the for m of dry ice  (see above) which is often easier to
acquire with muc h less equipment needed to use it.  Becaus e of this,
I'll be limiting  this section to the use  of compress ed nitrogen.  If for
some reason you prefer to use comp ressed CO2 the inf ormation given below
will work for it as well, though cylinde r sizes may differ.
     In the U.S.  there are about eight princip al suppliers of compress ed
gasses:  Air Liq uide, Airco, Linde, Air Products, Matheson , Liquid
Carbonic, MG Industries, and Scott.  One or more of these producers
should have compressed gasses available in virtually every area of the
United States and Cana da.
     Locat ing a source  of compress ed nitrogen is probably as easy as
looking in your local phone book under the hea dings ""compressed gas
suppliers"", ""gasses"", or ""welding supplies"".  Other sources might be
automotive supply houses, universi ty or college research departm ents,
vo-tech schools,  and medical  supply houses.
     Nitro gen is gener ally availab le in a number of forms ranging from
gas intended for welding, to vario us purity assured types, to gas
mixtures where N2 woul d be one of the componen ts.
     Unles s you are very kno wledgeable about compres sed gasses and the
equipment needed to use them  it is stron gly recommen ded that you  not use
any gas mixtures  in your foo d storage, but rat her to stay with pure
nitrogen gas.  Use of compressed gas mix tures requires knowledge and
equipment beyond the scope of this  FAQ.
IMPORTANT NOTE:    Welding nitroge n is essenti ally a pure gas, but it                   has  one importa nt caveat.  When a cylin der of weldi ng
gas is used there is an unkn own possibil ity that som e form of
contaminant may have backfed  into the cylinder  from a previous user.
Possibly this could happen if the tank was bei ng used in an appl ication
where the cylinder's interna l pressure fell low enou gh for pressure from
whatever the tan k had been feeding  to backflus h into the cylinde r.
Alternatively, the tan k pressure may hav e become depleted and was
repressurized using ordinary  compressed service air.  The most likely
contaminants will be moistur e, carbon monoxide , carbon dioxide, oxygen
and hydrocarbons, but there is the remote possibility of somethi ng even
more exotic or toxic getting  into your cylinde r.  Welding gas cylinder s
may not be check ed by the gas supp lier before being refilled and sent
back out for use .  It is this remote, but unkn own possibil ity of
contamination that cau ses me to recommen d against the use of welding
grade nitrogen in food  storage.  If your  supplier is willi ng to certify
that welding gas cylinders are che cked before refilling then the y would
be OK to use.
     The varying  types of purity assured  nitrogen gas are slightly more
difficult to find and slightly more expensive in cost, but I believe
this is more tha n made up for by the fac t you know exactly  what you're
getting.  Air Liquide,  as an examp le, offers seven types of puri ty
assured nitrogen  ranging from 99.995% to 99.99 95% pure wit h none having
a water vapor content over 1 part per million (ppm) or an oxygen content
over 3 ppm.  Any of them are  eminently suited to the task so the most
inexpensive form is all you need buy.
     As you migh t expect, compress ed gas cylinders come in a num ber of
different sizes.  For the sake of simplicity I will address only the
most common cylinder sizes since they will alm ost certainl y be the mos t
inexpensive as well.
     Again  using Air Liquide  as an examp le, it is their size 44 and 49
cylinders that are the  most common.  There are other cylinder sizes of
smaller physical  dimensions and capaciti es.  However , the logistics of
compressed gas product ion and tran sport being what they are, the y
frequently will cost as much  or even mor e than the larger,  more common
sizes.  The actu al gas inside the cylinder is fairly cheap.  Filling and
moving the heavy cylinders around is not.

     As you can see, the siz e 49 cylinde r from Air Liquide  has an
equivalent from all eight manufact urers.  This size is the one commonl y
seen being used to fill helium balloons at county fairs and ball  games.
     B.2.2   OBTAINING THE GAS AND NECESSARY EQUIPMEN T
     Altho ugh you can purchase your own cylinder the most inexpensive
way to use nitrogen is to rent a cylinde r from your gas supplier .  This
may require filling out an applica tion, paying a refundable cylinderdeposit and buyi ng the gas contain ed in the cylinder .  Tank rental
periods can vary , but the most com mon is for thirty days.
     Havin g rented or purchased the cyli nder you mus t now get it home.
Delivery by the supplier can often be arranged  or they may  assist you in
getting the cyli nder into your veh icle.  The preferr ed method of
transportation is for the cylinder  to be chain ed, clamped or otherwise
solidly secured in a vertica l position in the transporting vehicle with
the cylinder cap in place.  Transp ortation requirements vary fro m nation
to nation,  state to state and even  city to city so your best bet  is to
inquire of your gas supplier  to find a safe and lega l means of moving
the tank.
IMPORTANT NOTE:    The major expense in using compressed gas is not the
                   cos t of obtaini ng the gas itself,  but in the
equipment needed to safely handle and control it.  Unless you can borr ow
the appropriate mechanisms they will hav e to be purc hased, new or used ,
and even the che apest regulator and gaug e are not inexpens ive.  There is
a temptati on to forgo the expense and not use a regulator, but I must
caution strongly  against this.  As table  1 above shows, a full cylinde r
of compres sed gas will  have an internal pressure of 2000+ PSIG.  Normal
atmospheric pressure is abou t 15 PSIA.  If the  cylinder valve was open ed
only slightly too far a great deal of very hig h pressure gas wil l flow
through the deli very hose and meta l wand and the pot ential for serious
injury when it began to whip  around would be very great.   For your
safety, get the necessary equipmen t.  If you purchas e your own
regulator/gauge cluster and/or your own cylinder, there is neces sity for
periodic mainten ance.  Regulators and gauges need to be calibrat ed
(using a water deadwei ght calibrat or) and cyli nders need to be
hydrostatically tested, typically every ten years for both .  Your gas
supplier can pro vide you wit h more detailed informat ion.
     The only equipmen t that will come with your cyl inder is the
cylinder cap.  ""Don't leave home without  it"" and the y mean it.  All of
the common cylinder sizes will use  the CGA-580  (Compressed Gas Assembl y)
cylinder fitting .  The downstream side of this  fitting can be obtained
with different threads , but a 1/4"" NPT (Nation al Pipe Thread) nipple is
normally needed to mate with the regulat or body.  The nipp le is really
nothing more tha n just a short length of high pressure pipe.  The CGA
fittings come in a var iety of meta l compositions such as carbon steel,
stainless steel and brass.  The best cho ice is one which matches  the
composition of the reg ulator body.  If the CGA  fitting and regulator are
to be used  only with dry, non-oxyg en gasses, in a dry envi ronment then
galvanic corrosi on can be disregar ded so the most inexpens ive metal
composition can be used even if it is not the same as the regulator.  If
it is to be used  in a wet area, or with oxygen containing gasses then
matching metal composi tion becomes  very important.
     When the tank is to be returned there must be some residual
pressure still in the cylinder or the renter might have to pay a
surcharge or lose their deposit.  This is part icularly true of purity
assured gasses because  the residua l gas composition will be anal yzed.
This is done for  the safety of all cylinder users.
     The regulat or/gauge cluster should be carefully removed using the
same procedure that is descr ibed below to put it all together. Care
should be taken not to damag e the cylinder valve threads. Replace the
cylinder cap and  transport in the same manner as you brought it home.     B.2.3   PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHE R
     If the fitt ing and regu lator are bought separat ely then som e 1/2""
wide Teflon tape is recommen ded for asse mbly since it is a clean  and
inexpensive way of sealing pipe joints.  Looking into the open end of
nipple wrap the tape clockwi se around the thre aded end for  1.5 to 2
turns, working from the open  end backwar ds.  If you want to do a neat
looking job, the  tape may be slit lengthways to make  it 1/4"" wid e, but
this is not a requirem ent.  A bras s nipple may shrink somewhat during
tightening and need a bit more tap e than a harder metal like sta inless
steel would.  The Tefl on tape should only be used on the end of the
nipple that attaches to the regulator body, NOT to any par t of the
cylinder end.
     The regulat or end has tapered  threads and uses them directl y for
sealing.  The cylinder  end has str aight threads and depends upon the
precision mating of machined  metal surfaces to seal.   The cylinder end
threads simply apply the cla mping force.
     Befor e attaching the CGA fitt ing to the cylinde r the user should
put on safety glasses and good hea ring protect ion.  The cylinder  valve
can then be crac ked very sli ghtly to blow out any dust or debris.  After
closing the valv e, inspect the cyl inder valve and nipple for any
abrasions, nicks, gouges, embedded  particles, etc., before attachment is
made.
     You will need two  wrenches (not adj ustable pliers) to equal ize the
torque, particul arly on the cylinder valve where it should be minimize d.
Put one wrench on the fitting and the other wrench on the cylinder valve
and make the joi n.
     Once the regulato r/gauge cluster has been  mated to the cyli nder,
the delivery hose can now fitted to the regulator and the metal wand to
the other end of the hose.  The wand is nothing more than a short length
of metal tubing at least six inches greater in lengt h than the depth of
the buckets to be fill ed.  Copper water line works well.
     When the joins have bee n made, a mixture of a short squirt of dish
washing detergen t and water can be used to check for leaks.  Be certain
the detergent does not  contain ammonia.  Pour some on each  fitting
working from the  cylinder end outw ard, opening  each valve and
pressurizing as you go.  Onc e the leak check is fini shed rinse off and
wipe down all surfaces  to minimize  the chance of accidents in the
future.
     If the gas is not to be used at that time then the cylinder  valve
should be closed and all pre ssure should be drained to zero in the
regulator and gauge.  This should be done any time that the tank  is not
in actual use.  If you  have purchased your own  cylinder then it is a
good idea to also acquire one of the pla stic valve plugs, similar to
those seen with propane cylinders, in order to prote ct the cylinder
valve threads and keep  dust, debris and insects out of the valve.
WARNING: Care should be take n that the cylinde r is used and stor ed in
         such a way as to minimize  the risk of the tank falling over.
With the regulat or and gauge attached there is an increase d likelihoodof damage occurring to the cylinde r valve should the tank fall.
Catastrophic failure of the cylinder valve will turn the tank into a
high-energy, unguided rocket with the capabili ty of doing great damage
and/or serious injury.
     B.2.4   PUTTING IT INTO USE.
     Havin g assembled and tested your gas syst em, you are now ready to
begin the work of pack aging your food.  You'll  need containers, and food
grade plastic or Mylar  bags that are a bit lar ger in inter nal volume
than the contain er.  Next is the dry foo d you intend to package and a
pack of matches or a cigaret te.  You'll also need to wear the safety
glasses and hear ing protecti on you wore when you put  the gas sys tem
together.
     Take the containe rs you are going to use to store your food in, the
bags that will line them and  the food you are putting up and pla ce them
in some warm (no t hot) area long enough for them all  to equalize  to that
temperature.  This wil l mean that the air cont ained inside them will
also be at a war m temperature and make it more  likely that it will sta y
on top whe n the cool gas fro m the nitrogen cylinder begins to flow in.
The warm gas bei ng on top will be the first to purge  from the containe r,
taking a good deal of the oxygen with it.
     Line the interior  of the cont ainer with a plast ic bag or Mylar bag.
Fill the contain er with the food product  shaking to get it as full as
possible.  Don't forget to add you r desiccant package if you're going to
use one.  You don't want any  pockets left between the plas tic bag and
the container.  Once you hav e gotten it full to just  short of not bein g
able to fully put on the lid , gather the top of the plastic bag together
or heat seal the  edges.  If you have sea led it, cut a small corner off
of the bag  just large enough to allow a probe to enter.
     At this poi nt you can either simply flush the bag as described
below or draw a vacuum  on it first  and then flush.  If usi ng a vacuum
the suction probe should be kept at the top of the bag, just ins ide of
the opening.  The gas wand should be inserted to the bottom of the
container, taking care not to poke  any holes in the liner bag.  Once
both instruments are inserte d, draw the vacuum.  When it has rea ched a
satisfactory level, shut of the suction,  maintain the seal  and turn on
the gas.
     Open the cylinder  valve and set the  regulator to a very slo w gas
flow and begin to fill  the bag wit h gas.  You want the con tainer to fill
slowly so you can mini mize turbule nce and mixi ng as much as you can.
It'll take a little while to fill each contain er, a few minutes per
bucket.  Just as with dry ice, the  idea here is for the cool gas  to
displace the war mer atmosphe re from the container.  The bag shou ld puff
just a bit.  When I think it's ful l I'll hold a lit match just above the
bag in the air that is escap ing from it.   If it snuf fs right out then I
let it run for about several  minutes longer to flush  out more of any
remaining oxygen and remove the wand.
     For the mos t efficient oxygen removal, repeat the suc tion/gas
flushing procedu re one more time.  When satisfied, tie or heat seal the
bag off and seal  the bucket.   Again, you want to have the bucket as full
as possibl e so that there'll  be only min imal air spa ce.  You sho uldmonitor the cont ainers for an hour  or two afte r filling to check  for any
signs of bulging  or other pressure  build up as the cool gas insi de
gradually warms up and expands.  A sligh t positive pressur e is OK, but
serious bulging needs some of the pressure released.
NOTE:    Althoug h the procedure for flus hing a conta iner with nitrogen
         is stra ightforward enough, actually getting  a good purge of the
container is not.  Nitrogen flushing works best when the content s of the
container are fairly coarse in size so that the gas flow around and
through the food  is free and  unrestricted.  Foods such as the larger
sized grains (corn, wheat, barley,  long grain rice, etc.), legumes and
non-powdered dehydrated foods are best suited to this technique.  Foods
with small particle sizes such as flours, meals, and dry milks will
flush with mediocre results.
     Becau se of the difficul ties in purg ing sufficie nt oxygen from a
container to lengthen the shelf life of the food it contains many
commercial suppliers have dropped this techniq ue in favor of using
oxygen absorbers.  There is no reason that ine rt gas flushing and oxyg en
absorbers cannot be used tog ether and one good  reason that they should.
If you are  using five gallon plastic buckets as your  storage containers,
it has bee n observed that absorber s used in unlined pails can cause the
air pressure inside the buck et to drop enough for the wall s to buckle,
possibly leading  to a seal breach or a stack collaps ing.  For this
reason, flushing  with inert gas (nitroge n or CO2) might be a goo d idea,
in order to purg e as much oxygen as poss ible so that  the pressur e drop
caused by the absorber  removing the rema ining oxygen will not cause the
bucket to buckle.  Liner bags can ameliorate the vac uum problems .
C -- OXYGE N ABSORBERS
     C.1  WHAT IS AN OXYGEN ABSORBER?
     If all of this messing about with gasses sounds like too much
trouble, you can  try using oxygen absorption packets .  I don't know
exactly when the y first showed up on the market, but they are a
relatively recent food storage tool.  The pack ets absorb free oxygen
from the air aro und them and  chemically bind it by oxidizi ng finely
divided iron int o iron oxide.  This removes it from being available for
other purposes such as oxida tive rancidi ty and respiration by insects,
fungi or aerobic  bacteria.  The practica l upshot of all this is that by
removing the fre e oxygen from your storage containers, you can greatly
extend the storage life of the foo ds in the containe rs.
     The absorbe rs themselves have only a relatively short life span,
roughly about six mont hs from the time they were man ufactured for the
types that do not need  external moisture .
     Findi ng any information about these absorbers has bee n difficult,
but, thanks to Al Durt schi, I was able to find  a study of their
effectiveness from Bri gham Young Univers ity.
     The study tested the absorpti on capacity of the Ageless Z300E
packets made by Mitsubishi Gas-Che mical.  It found they were eve n more
effective than their rated absorpt ion capacity  of 300 mill iliters of
oxygen (O2 at sea leve l pressure).  A single packet sealed into an empty#10 can (80% of one gallon) reduced the oxygen in the cann ed air to less
than 1/2%.
     The followi ng is the verbatim  text of the conclusions section of
the Brigham Young study.  See V.B Pamphlets for the complete citation of
this study.
Conclusions:
     ""Oxyg en absorbing packets are effective in redu cing oxygen
     conte nts in seale d cans.  The ageless Z300 packet has a
     great er than claimed capacity  for absorbi ng oxygen.  Packet s
     abuse d by 4 hour- exposure-to-air still exceed claimed
     capac ity.  It may  be economic al to use smaller packets based
     on the dead  air volume instead of can vol ume.  Smalle r
     packe ts would have less tolerance for abu se and personnel
     would  need to be more diligen t in protect ing the pack ets.""
     ""The level of oxygen remainin g in the pre sence of the
     absor ber packets is sufficiently low to greatly  retard
     devel opment of rancidit y.  The biol ogical consequences are
     not so easy  to predict.   Microorganisms range from aerobic to
     anaer obic, thus no unqu alified statement can be made.   The
     energ y requirements of anaerobic bacteria  are met by
     react ions between  oxygen and more than one othe r molecule.
     This makes bacterial energy a highe r order of reactio n than
     ranci dity.  Thus, the rate of bacte rial aerobic  reaction
     would  be more ser iously retarded than ran cidity.  These
     matte rs are not of prac tical importance because  the product s
     to be canne d should be too dry to support  microbial growth.
     Insec ts are aerobic and would like-wise suffer retardation of
     activ ity.  No com prehensive stateme nt can be made abo ut
     irrev ersible inactivation or death of insects.  As long as
     the oxygen level remains low, insect activity will be lower
     by at least  the square root of oxyg en content.  In a
     pract ical sense, these packets are effective in stopp ing
     insec t activity.  USDA does not rec ognize any method except
     disin tegration as effec tive for com pletely killing insect
     eggs. ""

     C.2  WHERE CAN I FIND OXYGEN ABSORBERS?
     Becau se they are a relatively new tool on the food preserva tion and
storage market, oxygen absorbers have not yet achieved a widespr ead
dissemination amongst the various storage food dealers and suppliers.
They are availab le, but you may have to do a bit of searching to find
them.
     The followi ng short list are the supplier s I've located, thus

     In addition  to the abov e suppliers it may be possible  to acquire
oxygen absorbers through a LDS fam ily cannery if you have one locally
available.  *Please see sect ion IV.A.2 for inf ormation on how to explo re
this possibility.*
     C.3  HOW ARE OXYG EN ABSORBERS USED?
     Even though the Z300E type will app arently absorb a great deal more
than the 300 ml of O2 they are rat ed for, the following instruct ions for
use are based on their  listed rating.  So, whe n using the Mitsubishi
Ageless Z300E oxygen absorpt ion packets,  you should allow one packet for
every quart and a half (1430 ml) of rema ining air volume in your  filled
storage containe rs.  The Fre shPax D750 from the Mult isorb Corporation
work with just over 3 quarts  (2860ml) of remai ning air vol ume.
     Now determi ning the vol ume of air remaini ng in a filled container
is no easy  thing.  In the study, #10 can s filled with either elbow
macaroni or powd ered milk were use d and their respective air vol umes
were determined.  A can full  of elbow macaroni  was found to cont ain 22%
remaining air volume and a can ful l of powdere d milk was found to
contain 10.5%.  With these as guid es, you shou ld then be able to rough ly
figure the remaining air vol ume of the foods you hav e in your
containers.  You'll have to decide whether the food you are work ing is
closer to the macaroni  or the dry milk in its packing density.
Obviously, this is a rather rule of thum b and this is why I kept my
instructions to the listed ratings  rather than on what the y will
apparently really do.  The excess capacity will thus serve to cover the
shortcomings of your reckoni ngs.  These absorption packets  should be
used only in dry foodstuffs and not with  any product  that will make them
wet or oily.
     Your absorbers begin their removal mission the second they come
into contact with oxygen, whether it be in your storage containe r or in
the open air wai ting to be used.  Try to arran ge things in such a way as
to have your con tainer packed and ready to go before exposing the
packets.  Take out onl y those you are going to be able to use up in no
more than about fifteen minutes or so else you  are losing valuable
absorption capacity.  When you tak e them out of thei r package, spread
them out on a tray so they do not contact each other.  The oxidation
reaction that absorbs the oxygen release s small amounts of heat.   The
warmer the packet becomes the fast er the reaction occurs so you do not
want the packets  warming each other.  Handle each one with  tongs, gloved
hands or by the edges of the envelope to keep body moistur e and skin
oils off.  Seal the lid or seam of the contain er as soon as the packets
have been inserted.
NOTES:
     #1 -- Both Multisorb and Mits ubishi corporations advise that their
oxygen absorbers should not be used in a high carbon dioxide
environment.  I haven' t yet been able to deter mine if this  is forreasons of chemi cal interact ion between the CO2 and the oxidatio n
reaction occurri ng in the absorber .
     #2 -- If you do choose to use oxygen absorbers in packing your food
storage containe rs you should give some consideration to the con tainer
you're using.  The abs orber is going be removing the 20% of the
atmosphere that oxygen constitutes.  Since nothing is repl acing it this
will leave the interio r of the sto rage contain er with a lower
atmospheric pressure than the outs ide.  If the  container is suff iciently
sturdy this pressure differe ntial will be of little consequence.  For
containers with thinner walls or more flexible  material the pres sure
drop could cause them partially collapse  or buckle, particularly if
other containers are stacked  upon them.  This could make them more
likely to lose seal integrit y.  Metal cans and  glass jars should have no
problems.  Plastic buckets made of HDPE are poor gas  barriers and shou ld
have a liner bag of Mylar or other  high gas barrier plastic when used
with absorbers.  Seal the absorber s inside of the liner bag so that the
pressure drop with not  stress the walls of the container.  Other
containers should probably be test ed or first flushed with an inert gas
(N2) before the absorber is sealed in.
     #3 -- If the pack  of absorber s you need to open  contains more tha n
you are going to use up in fifteen  minutes or so, you shou ld minimize
exposure of the remaining packets.   This can be done  by heat sea ling the
bag they came in with an iron after expelling as much air as possible or
better yet by vacuum sealing  the bag.  You can  also put the rema ining
absorbers in as small a jar or metal can as they wil l fit in and closing
with an air tigh t lid.
     #4 -- If absorber s are sealed in a packag e with desiccants some
thought should be give n to just how low the relative  humidity will be
dropped.  Silica  gel will reduce humidit y to approxi mately 40% which
should not interfere with the abso rbers oxidation reaction .  Other
desiccants, however, are cap able of redu cing relativ e humidity to very
low levels.  This might adversely affect your absorber's ability  to
carry out its mission by removing moisture from the absorber package
that is necessar y to sustain  the oxidati on reaction.
               
D -- DESIC CANTS
     D.1  WHAT IS A DESICCAN T?
     Moist ure in inapp ropriate amounts and pla ces is very damaging to
the useful life of food.  Because of this, much effort is put into
reducing the wat er content of dry foods in order to prolong their shelf
lives.  Once it is reduced to the desired level the product can then be
packaged for sto rage.  Unfortunately, merely reducin g moisture content
is not alw ays sufficie nt.  Environ mental conditions can play a role as
well.
     There  are four mechanis ms by which environmental conditions may
cause a moisture  problem in your food storage:
    1. - The air  trapped in the containe r with the food may have  held
    suffic ient humidit y to raise the moi sture content of the foo d to
    undesi rable levels.    2. - Even if the water vapor content  wasn't too high, a falling
    temper ature level may cause the trap ped humidity  to reach its dew
    point causing water to be sque ezed out of the air to condens e on
    your food much the  same way as dew forms on your  lawn on cool
    mornin gs after a warm, humid night.
    3. - The sea l of the con tainer may not be sufficiently tight enough
    to pre vent moistur e from leaking in.
    4. - The pac kaging material itself may be porous to one degr ee or
    anothe r to water vapor.  All paper, wood and car dboard has this
    fault.   Depending upon their particu lar physical  properties many
    plasti cs do as well.  Metal and glas s containers have excellent
    barrie r properties though their seals may not.
     The solutio n for moisture problems is multi-faceted.  First, make
sure the product  to be store d is at an appropr iate water content  for
that particular foodstuff.  Beans and grains store quite well at a 10%
moisture level, but milk pow ders, dried eggs and deh ydrated or freeze
dried foods should be lower for best res ults.
     Secon dly, try to package your goods in a cool, dry atmosphe re and
do not all ow extreme tempera ture swings in storage areas.  Warm
temperatures and high relative humidities when a container is sealed
means the air trapped inside the contain er will have a high dew point.
This will lead to cond ensation should storage temperatures fall below
that dew point.  An example of this would be a conta iner sealed on a day
that was 70 deg.  F and 40% relativ e humidity.  At that tem perature the
relative humidit y would be quite reasona ble for all but the most
moisture sensiti ve food.  However,  should the temperature fall to 44
deg. F the capacity of the air to hold water vapor would have dropped to
the point that it coul d not contain what was sealed in at 77 deg. and
the excess would be squeezed  out to cond ense on the food, i.e. - it will
get wet.  Possib ly the food will be able  to adsorb this moisture  without
harm and then again, it may not.
     Third ly, use appr opriate packaging materials and make  certain it is
sealed correctly.  If you are goin g to consume  them in four to five
years, storing grains,  beans and peas in unlin ed HDPE buckets at norma l
humidities is fine.  If you want to keep  them at their best for ten
years or more, the pla stic the pai l is made of is too poro us to water
vapor for best results  and should have an inte rior liner of a material
with better barrier properti es.  Dry mil k powders should not be kept for
more than a year in unlined HDPE, but can be kept for much  longer in #10
metal cans, glass jars or Mylar bags.  Natural ly, even the  most highly
resistant packaging material  is useless if its seal isn't good so be
sure you use goo d technique when making closures.
     Lastl y, you may wish to consi der using a desicc ant if good humidity
control at the time of packi ng is difficult or if you are not confiden t
of the foo ds' moisture  content or if the storage area is in a high
humidity environ ment or if the pac kaging material does not  have
sufficiently high barrier properti es.
     A des iccant is a substa nce with ver y ""hygroscopic"" properti es,
meaning it will soak up wate r vapor from the air sur rounding it.  A
number of different substanc es are capable of doing this, but only a
relative few of them are of practical use and fewer still are going tobe readily  available to the average person.  Before elaborating on the
different types that might be usef ul for our purpose s it's necessary to
explain how to choose a desiccant.
     The U.S. military  has done much of the best res earch on the use of
desiccants in packagin g and have largely  set the sta ndards by which they
are judged.  Each type of desiccan t has temperature and humidity  ranges
where it perform s best and particu lar physical  and chemica l
characteristics that may nee d to be cons idered in relation  to what you
propose to do with the m.
     The standar d most applicable for what can  be done in home food
storage defines a unit of desiccan t as *the amount of desi ccant that
will adsorb at least 6 grams  of water vapor at 40% relativ e humidity at
77 deg. F (25 deg. C). *
     The followi ng table gives the amount of desicca nt necessary per
square area for flexible containers such as Mylar bags or per volume of
area for rigid contain ers such fiv e gallon pails or #10 metal cans.  The
actual weight of a par ticular desiccant to use will depend upon the
adsorbency per unit of desic cant mass.

     In order to maxim ize surface area to obta in optimal adsorpt ion,
desiccants are manufac tured in granular or powder forms.  This present s
a problem of keeping the des iccant, which may not be safe for direct
contact with foo d, out of the prod uct while still allowing  sufficient
air flow for it to carry out its task.  Manufa cturers call this
""dusting"" and deal wit h it by pack aging the adsorben t in materia ls such
as uncoate d Tyvek, a spunbon ded high-den sity polyeth ylene material
produced by the Dupont corporation.  Unfortunately, I have not yet bee n
able to locate a retai l source of uncoated Tyvek, just the  coated
variety such as is used in postal envelopes.  Second  best, and what I
use, is one or more layers of coff ee filter paper securely  sealed over
the mouth of the container holding  the desicca nt.  I've also mad e
""cartridges"" of filter paper for use in narrow necked containers such as
two-liter bottles.  For this  I used ordinary white glue, but get ting a
good seal all the way around without sealing too muc h surface area
requires some care in execution.     For coarse granular materials tightly woven fabrics might serve the
purpose providin g the seams were adequat e.
     D.2  TYPES OF DESICCANTS
          D.2.1  SILICA GEL
     The most commonly  known and used desiccan t is silica gel which is a
form of silica dioxide  (SiO2), a natural ly occurring mineral.  It will
work from below freezing to past the boi ling point of wate r, but
performs best at room temperatures (70-90 deg. F) and high  humidity
(60-90%). Its performa nce begins to drop  off over 100 deg.  F, but will
continue to work  until approximately 220 deg. F.  It will drop the
relative humidit y in a conta iner down to aroun d 40% at any temperature
in its ran ge until it is saturated.  Silica gel will  absorb up to 40% of
its weight in moisture .  It is the only desiccant that is approved by
the FDA for dire ct food use.  It recharg es easily and does  not swell in
size as it adsor bs moisture.
     In the reta il trade, the most  commonly found form of silica gel is
*indicating silica gel* which are small white crystals looking much like
granulated sugar with small pink or blue  colored crystals scattered
throughout.  This is ordinar y silica gel with the colored specks being
coated with cobalt chloride, a heavy metal salt.  When the  gel has
absorbed approxi mately eight percent of its weight in wate r the colored
crystals will turn fro m blue to pink mak ing an easy visual indicator of
whether the gel has become saturat ed with moisture.  Because cobalt is a
heavy metal, indicating silica gel is not food  safe and should be kept
from spilling into any thing edible.
     When saturated, silica gel can be dried out and  used again. This is
accomplished by heating the crystals in an oven at a tempe rature of no
more than 300 deg. F for app roximately three hours or unti l the crystals
turn blue.  Dehydrating the desiccant may also  be accompli shed by
heating in a mic rowave oven.  Using a 900 watt  oven heat the cry stals
for three minute intervals until the col or change occurs.  The exact
amount of time necessa ry will depend upon the oven wattage .  Spreading
the desiccant in a bro ad pan in a shallo w layer will speed the process
Heating to 325 deg. F or mor e, or by using a microwa ve oven over 900
watts can damage the gel.
     Altho ugh I've nev er found anything that mention s this, apparently
it is poss ible for sil ica gel to break down over tim e, or at least the
colored crystals  can.  I had a five pound can stored in an outsi de shed
here in Florida for several years before I opened it again  to use some
of it.  Nearly all of the colored indicator specks had bro ken down and
disappeared.  I don't know if the gel itself was sti ll good and with no
way to reliably determine whether it was saturated or not,  I discarded
it.  The can the  gel was in was just car dboard and it gets  very humid
here in Florida so it really was very poorly stored.   Under decent
conditions it may not break down at all.   (I've never heard of this
occurring, anyway.)
          D.2.2 CLAY DESICCA NT     Altho ugh not typi cally found for sale on the retail market,  clay
desiccant is fairly common in comm ercial and industr ial use. The  primary
reason for this seems to be that it is inexpen sive compare d to any oth er
form of desiccan t.
     The materia l is *Montmo rillonite clay*, compose d primarily of
magnesium aluminum silicate, a naturally occurring mineral .  After
mining it is purified, reduced to granules and subjected to a controll ed
dehydration process to incre ase its sorb ent porosity .  It recharges
easily and does not swell as it adsorbs water vapor.  It works well at
low and room tem peratures, but has  a rather low ceil ing temperat ure. At
120 deg. F it will beg in to desorb or shed the  moisture it has adsorbe d.
This is an impor tant conside ration for storage  in hot area s.
     Subje ct to a degree of variability for being a natura l material,
clay desiccant will adsorb approxi mately 25% of its weight in water
vapor at 77 deg.  F and 40% relativ e humidity.
          D.2.3  CALCIUM OXIDE
     Also known as ""quicklime"" or ""unslaked lime"", calcium  oxide is a
slow, but strong adsorbent.  It is effic ient at low humidities and can
drop moisture vapor to below  10% relativ e humidity.  Qucklime is
*caustic* and must be carefully handled,  particularly with regards to
dust inhalation and exposure  to skin and  eyes.  It expands  as it soaks
up water vapor and thi s must be taken into acc ount when packagin g it.
It will adsorb up to about 28% of its weight in mois ture, but does it
slowly over a period of seve ral days rat her than a matter of hours like
other desiccants.  It is most effective when used in high humidity
environment where a very low  level is desired.   It will release a great
deal of heat if exposed to direct (liquid) moisture or extreme
humidities.
     It can be recharg ed, but I do not have any deta ils on how to go
about this other than roasting at fire tempera tures.
     For expedie nt use, quicklime can be manuf actured from clean, pure
lime stone or pickling  lime available in the canning  sections of many
grocery and hard ware stores.
          D.2.4  CALCIUM SULFATE
     Also known as the mineral gypsum and comm ercially as Drierite,
calcium sulfate is another natural ly occurring mineral. It is produced
by the con trolled dehydration of gypsum (CaSO4). It is chemically stable
and does not rea dily release  its adsorbe d moisture.  It has a low
adsorbency capacity, only approxim ately 10% of it weight.  It can be
regenerated, but apparently not easily so.
     For expedie nt use, gypsum is commonly used in househo ld drywall and
Kearny mentions using this source in his Nuclear War Survival Skills.
          D.2.5  OTHER DESICCANTS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------From: Pyotr Filipivich pyotr@coho.halcyon.com
     Simpl e trick is to dry a piece of wood in the oven and once  it is
bone dry (more than usual) then put it in your  container and sea l it.
The wood will suck up any availabl e moisture.
     Edito rs note:  Wood can  soak up to 14% of its weight in moisture,
depending on species.  Woods with coarse, open grains work the best.
I'm not aware at what temperature it will begin to ""desorb "" or shed its
stored water and it might be fairl y low.  Some empirical experim entation
would be in orde r before relying heavily  on it.
     D.3  WHERE DO I FIND DESICCAN TS?
     I buy  indicating silica gel at Wal- Mart in thei r dry flower section
where it is sold  in one and five pound cans for flow er drying.  I've
seen it sold the  same way in craft s stores and other department type
stores that carry flower-arranging supplies.  You can also  buy it from
many other businesses already prepackaged in one for m or another  to be
used as an adsor bent.  All of the desiccant that I'v e found packaged
this way has bee n rather expensive (to me) so shop careful ly.
     Busin esses carrying packaging supplies sometime s also sell
desiccants.  Some businesses commonly receive packets or bags of
desiccants packaged along with the  products they rec eive.  I've seen
Montmorillonite clay in bags  as large as a pou nd shipped with pianos
coming in from Japan.  Small packets of silica gel seem to be packed in
nearly everything.  Naturall y, any salvaged or recyc led desiccan t should
be of a type app ropriate for use with the prod uct you want  to package.
     It is possi ble to make your own des iccants using gypsum from
drywall and mayb e Plaster of Paris .  Calcium oxide can als o be produce d
from limestone (calciu m carbonate) or slaked or pick ling lime (calcium
hydroxide) by roasting  to drive off the adsorbed water and carbon
dioxide.  I don' t have any clear instruc tions, as of yet, on how to go
about this.  Please do keep in mind that calcium oxide (quicklime) is
caustic in natur e and is hazardous if handled incorrectly.
     D.4  HOW DO I USE  DESICCANTS?
     Ideal ly, the dry foodstuffs you hav e on hand will hav e no more than
a 10% mois ture content .  If they do not then you wil l need to reduce
moisture to a level appropri ate for the kind of food  you are sto ring.
     One of the following methods might be of use in lower ing moisture
content.  The least involved  is to wait until the driest time of year
for your locatio n making sure there is plenty of free air circulation
around the food product.  If this doesn't suit, then turn your air
conditioning on a little high.  Bring in your buckets, lids, and the
storage food.  Let eve rything sit in a well-ventilat ed place where it's
going to get ple nty of cool,  dry air fro m the A/C (avoid anywher e near
the kitchen or bathroo m areas, as they put out  a lot of moisture ).  Stir
the food frequen tly to maxim ize moisture  loss.  About three days of
cool, constant air flo w and low humidity  ought to dry thin gs out a bit.
Due to its highly odor absorptive nature, I would not do this with anydried milk products or other  powdered foods, flours or meals .  This
method works best with coarse particles such as grai n, legumes and dri ed
foods.
     Warm,  dry air can  also be used to accompl ish this and  works well if
you have large quantit ies of grain s and legumes.  It is very sim ilar to
what is used on farms for drying harvest ed grain. You'll need a source
of forced,  warm, *not hot*, air.  Place the grain in a dru m or barrel
and blow the hea t from the bottom so that the warm and the  moisture it
will carry can exit from the  top.  It's important to not let the  bottom
product get too hot.  You should also monitor the top, cen ter of the
drum to be certa in that the product there is not get ting too dam p from
the moisture escaping from other areas.  Stirring occasion ally may be
necessary.  I've seen this done with an old, drum style vacuum cleaner
that put off fai rly warm exh aust air and  it worked pretty well.  Do be
sure to clean the vacu um so you don't blow the  grain full of dust.
     If the abov e methods won't do or you have  powdery foods to dry, you
can place a large quantity of desi ccant in a storage  container.  Fill
the remaining space with you r food product and seal on the lid.  After
about a week, unseal and che ck the desiccant.  If it's sat urated, change
it out wit h dry desiccant and rese al.  Continu e to do this  until the
contents are suf ficiently dry.  Calcium oxide will work particul arly
well for this.  If it doesn't become saturated the first time, change it
anyway before sealing the bucket permane ntly.  You'd hate to find later
it saturat ed in storage.
     If your foo d products are suf ficiently dry you can pack the m in
storage containe rs using the packaging method of your choice and have a
reasonable expectation of your foo d staying in good condition.  Whethe r
you will need to use a desic cant will be depen dent upon the cond itions
discussed above.
     I use  indicating silica gel for pra ctically everything.  My usual
procedure is to save or scro unge clear plastic  pill bottles, such as
500ct aspirin bottles or small plastic jars, such as the smaller  sizes
of peanut butter comes in.  Fill the bot tle with the  desiccant (rememb er
to dry the  gel first) and then use  a double thicknes s of coffee filter
paper carefully and securely  tied around the neck of the bottle to keep
any of it from leaking  out.  The paper is very  permeable to mois ture so
the gel can do its ads orbing, but it's tight enough not to let the
crystals out.  This way mois ture can be safely adsorbed.  It won 't dry
out a lot of moisture -- you still need to take steps to get eve rything
as dry as possible before you pack  it -- but it will  take care of what
little is left.
     The above method will also work for  the other desicca nts, subject
to whateve r precautions the individual type may have .
IMPORTANT NOTE:    The indicating form of sili ca gel (has small blue or
                   pin k specks in it) is not edible so you want to use
care when putting together your desiccan t package to insur e that is does
not spill into your food.
                             
E -- DIATO MACEOUS EARTH
                             
     E.1  WHAT IS DIAT OMACEOUS EARTH?     Diato maceous earth is a natur ally occurri ng substance comprised of
the fossilized remains  of marine diatoms .  These diatoms are mic roscopic
in size and are covered in sharp spines that make them dan gerous to
exoskeletal insects, but not  to animals with interna l skeletons.  The
spines of the diatom skeleto ns pierce the soft  body tissues of insects
between their hard exo skeletal plates and it is thro ugh these numerous
microscopic wounds that the insect loses bodily moisture to the point of
desiccating and dying.  Creatures with interna l skeletons such as
humans, cattle and pet s have means of resistin g such damage and are not
harmed.  Thus, it is possibl e to mix a small amount of DE into your
stored grains and bean s to control  insects without having to remove the
dust again before you consume them.
                             
     E.2  WHERE DO I FIND D.E. AND  WHAT TYPE SHOULD I BUY?
IMPORTANT NOTE:    There are actually two kind s of diatoma ceous earth to
                   be found on the market and only one of them is
suitable for use  as an insec ticide to use in your stored grains.   The
kind that you DO NOT WANT FOR FOOD  USE is the type sold by swimm ing pool
suppliers as a filteri ng agent.  It has been subject ed to a heat
treatment that dramati cally increases it's sil icate content and makes it
unsuitable for use wit h your foodstuffs.  The type that you want  is sold
by a numbe r of supplie rs as a garden insecticide.  Many organic garden
suppliers will carry it.  Read the  label carefully to be certain  no
deleterious substances such as chemical pesticides have been add ed.  An
appendix with the name s and addresses of some DE suppliers may be foun d
in the foo d and equipment supplier s section.

     Good afternoon all.  Diatomac eous earth is appr oved by the USDA as
an animal feed additiv e, however I have found out that the re are vast
differences between various forms of diatomaceous earth.  Some DE
products may not  be effectiv e in control ling insects , while others may
be harmful  to humans and pet s.  The most  important differe nces between
individual forms of DE is the shap e of the dia tom, content  of
Crystalline Silica, and the purity of the Sili ca Dioxide.  The World
Health Organization cautions  that DE with a crystall ine silica content
of three percent  or higher is dang erous to humans, (and probably  pets
and birds as well).  Diatoma ceous Earth used in swim ming pool filters
has close to a 60% cry stalline silica content.   I know of a product
called Organic Solutio ns (insecticide) which is appr oved by both  the EPA
and USDA and has  a crystalline silica content ranging between 0.36% to
1.12% according to its labels etc.  It is clas sified as Amorphou s Fresh
Water Diatomaceous Earth (whatever that means).  However, all literatu re
I have rea d assures it is safe for  both humans and animals  and seems to
be very effectiv e at killing  insects.  I stumb led across all thi s info.

[previous text deleted ]
     I hav e always purchased DE at the local feed store.  It's cheaper
there than at the gard en and hardware stores.  The feed store I buy at
has DE available in bulk, but they 'll package up a smaller  amount if
that's what you want.  My package in the garage doesn't have a brand
name but says ""Nitron Industries"" at the bottom.  The labe l recommends 7
pounds of DE for each ton of grain .  Ha! As if I had  ""tons"" of grain in
storage 8-D
     I've been using DE for grain storage for about 15 years now but
flea control only for the past 6 years.  The only fleas we've seen in
that period of time is the ones that hit ch a ride in with friends pets.
A very lig ht dusting afterwa rd takes care of that problem.   Miracle
stuff as far as I'm concerne d since we'd had an awfu l time with fleas
before we started using DE.  Much much much cheaper and as far as I'm
concerned the advantag es FAR outweigh the risk s.

(hope that was helpful )
     E.3  HOW DO I USE  D.E. IN FOOD STORAGE?
     To use, you  should mix thoroughly one cup  of DE to every forty
pounds of grain, grain products or legum es.  You nee d to make certain
that every kernel is coated so it is better to do the mixi ng in small
batches where you can insure more even coating .
WARNING: DE is a very powdery kind of dust, so you need to take steps to
         keep it out of your  lungs and eyes. Even whole wheat flour dust
         can cau se lung irritation if you brea th enough of it.
     DE does not  kill the insect eggs or pupae , but it will kill adults
and larvae and any egg s or pupae that hatch into adu lts will die  after
coming into contact with it.

                              SHEL F LIVES
=======================================================================
         
     ""How long will this kee p?""  This is the definin g question of food
storage.  Everyt hing you wil l read in this wor k evolves from thi s
central question .  The length of time a partic ular food will rem ain
palatable and nutritio us in storage determines its usefuln ess for our
purposes.  The fact of the matter is that there are few hard and  clear
answers.  As a result it is not uncommon  to find two  or more sou rces who
purport to know,  but that give con flicting data.  The foll owing will
hopefully cut through some of the fog.     A. ""BEST USED"", ""USE BY"" AND OTHER FOOD PRODUCT  DATES
     Altho ugh there are some  twenty States in the U.S. tha t have food
product dating laws the Fede ral governme nt has little regulation
concerning food product dating except for infa nt formulas and some bab y
foods.  It does,  however, require that if a manufact urer puts a calend ar
date on a food product  it must als o put wording to the eff ect of ""use
by"" or ""best before"" next to it to expla in what the date means.  This is
called ""open dating"" which is to say tha t it is a plain, easy to read
calendar date rather than ""closed or coded dating"" that must be
deciphered.  Another date also com monly seen is the ""sell by"" date.
While not as useful for food  storage, it does have importa nce for
day-to-day fresh food purchases.
     Becau se the Federal government has so few food product dating
standards manufacturers use their own to deter mine accepta ble shelf
lives.  For the most part, they are base d upon changes in texture,
appearance, taste and cooking qualities.  When a food item begins to
exhibit signs of aging  that would make it unap pealing to custome rs then
it is cons idered to be at the end of its marketable shelf life.  Look
for statements such as ""use by"", ""best if used  by"", ""best if used
before"" or simil ar wording to find  this date.  For shelf stable and
frozen products it must include both the  month, day and year.  These
dates are useful for determi ning how lon g a product can be retai ned in
the storage program before it shou ld be rotated out.  When a food begins
to undergo  taste and appeara nce degradat ion the nutr ient content  will
have begun to seriousl y fade and the tim e will have come to use it up so
it can be replaced with fresh stock.  If the product  was properl y
preserved and not subj ected to extreme storage  conditions it is not
unsafe to use after this dat e.  If there  is nothing to replace it with
it may be kept, but its pala tability and nutritive content  will just
continue to degr ade.
     Fresh  food items such as meat , milk and eggs use a ""sell by"" date
which simply means that the item should not be purch ased beyond that
date.  Products using this date type are  only required to use the day
and month.  Provided that it was properl y transported and stored, an
item kept past this date is not unsafe to use,  but will begin to exhib it
signs of aging that will mak e it unappea ling and sho uld be froze n or
consumed shortly  thereafter.
NOTE:    The she lf life of any foo d, whether indicat ed with a ""use by""
         or ""sel l by"" date or foun d on some chart, is pred icated upon
assumed storage conditions.  If the actu al storage conditi ons are
different from the ass umed storage  conditions then the she lf life will
naturally vary. As is explained in *Sect ion I:  Time , Temperature,
Moisture, Oxygen and Light*,  environmental storage conditi ons have a
major impact on the length of time  any foodstu ff will remain palatable,
nutritious and even whether it will remain safe.
     As a genera l rule, when a shelf life is given, it is for conditio ns
of 70 deg.  F in a dark, dry location unless stated otherwi se.  Be sure
to read the fine  print on any shel f life chart you may com e across to
see what its val ues are pred icated upon.  There are some floatin g around
giving shelf lives of foods in storage tempera tures as low as 40 deg. F.
At that temperat ure you woul d expect to keep your fresh butter, eggs andmilk, but very few hav e the ability to keep any sign ificant amount of
canned goods in so cool a storage area.
     Regar dless of what the date or char t may indicate, if stora ge
conditions have been very poor the n a food wil l become non-nutritious,
unpalatable, perhaps even unsafe to eat even if its listed time is not
yet up.  An exam ple of this would be keeping egg sal ad at room
temperature for several hours at a picni c.  The eggs  may have been lai d
yesterday, but you are  taking your chances if you eat it.  Never put
blind faith in any dat e.  Always keep in mind that they are pred icated
on unspoke n assumptions.  IF THE CONTAIN ER IS BULGING, MOLDED, FOUL
SMELLING OR SPEW S LIQUID WHEN OPENED, THROW IT OUT!  But throw it out
safely so that childre n and animals cannot get into it.
*Please see Sect ion III: Spo ilage for further information*
     B. CLOSED DATING CODES USED BY SOME  FOOD MANUFACTURERS.
     In spite of the fact that inc reasing numbers of food processing
companies are moving to open  dating it is not yet universa l.  For thos e
products that do not come with a plain ""best used by"" date  it is still
possible, albeit with much more difficul ty, to deter mine the rot ation
period for that specific product.
     For a proce ssor to move  their product in interstate commerc e it
must exhibit a packing  code.  This allows them to easily track their
product for purp oses of stoc k rotation and in the event of a rec all.
These packing codes are usua lly a series  of letters and numbers that
indicate dates, times, and sometim es places of manuf acture.  These dates
are not ""use by""  dates, but the time the  container was act ually filled.
As they are not really intended for gene ral public knowled ge these codes
are frequently unique to a particu lar processo r and are not comm only
published by them.
     It is possi ble to get the key s to these codes by cont acting the
processor and asking how to decipher the dating code for specifi c
product lines.  Over time, readers  have been doing this and the code
keys below are the one s that have been sent to me.  Obviou sly, they are
only a few of the many , many products that use  closed dating and I hope
that future readers will con tinue to send these codes in as they  are
gleaned from the  processors.
     Frank ly, when it comes to the potential dozens of products that
would require decipher ing their packing codes the entire process  is a
major nuisance.  While it is bette r to have an encod ed date than not to
have one at all,  it would be far better if processors would just use
clear open dating and (best used by) so we wouldn't have to carr y a book
of code keys lik e covert agents every time we go to the grocery.
     Befor e I list spe cific manufacturers there is one fai rly widely
used code key that may  be useful.  Some processors use a system where
all the days of the year are  listed 1-365 (366  for leap year) as the
first three digits in the code.  This number is then  followed by a
single letter such as ""B"" and then  by a single  digit that represents the
year.     Some examples of this might be:
     Packi ng code        Dat e packed
     045B9 7              Feb ruary 14, 1997

     252U9 8              Oct ober 31, 199 8
     There  may be othe r widely used coding systems yet to be discovered
and as they become available I will include them in this work.
                                                   
     SPECI FIC PRODUCT LINES:
IMPORTANT NOTE:    I have not pers onally verified all of these code
                   key s.  Also, closed date coding schemes  may change
over time.  For this reason,  the code keys giv en below may not be
correct.  Be sur e to check a numbe r of contain ers in a pro duct line to
verify that a particul ar code key will work with the  product line you
are interested in.
                                                   
     ARMOU R STAR CANNED MEAT PRODUCTS
     Vienn a Sausage, Stew, Chili, Deviled Ham, Potted Meat, Slice Dried
Beef, Soups, etc. but does NOT inc lude Armour Star Roast Beef or Corne d
Beef.
     The code is on the bott om of the containe r.  The firs t letter is
the month of production; A=January, B=February, C=March and so on.  The
following two numbers represent the day of the month it was proc essed
and the third number indicat es the year.
     Examp le:  A code of B148C23 would be B=Fe b, 14 = the fourteenth
day, 8=1998.  B148C23= February 14, 1998 and the last  three characters
would be plant or proc essing line locations.
     Armou r Star Microwaveable Meals have a two line  production code on
the container lid.  The seco nd line is the is date and use s the same
code as above.
     BERTO LLI OLIVE OIL
     Packe d two years prior to the use by date  on the bott le or can.
     BUSH BROTHERS & CO.
     Baked  beans, chili, etc.
     A fiv e digit code on the bott om of the can.  The firs t digit is the
month, the next two digits is the day of the month, the next num ber is
the year and the  last digit is ignored.
     Examp le:  A code of 50173 deciphers to be:     5  = the fifth month or May
     01 = the first day of May
     7  = 1997
     3  = last number is discarded.
     Thus 50173 is May 1st, 1997.
     CAMPB ELL SOUPS:
    Best by date  on cans.  Filled exactly two years prior to that date.
     DEL MONTE
    Canned  fruits, vegetables, etc.  I'm not sure if it applies to
*all* product lines.
    A five  character packing  code, usually on the bottom.  The first
character is a digit represe nting the year.  The nex t three characters
are digits representing the day of the year the prod uct was pack ed.  The
last character is a letter and may  be ignored.
    Exampl e:  A packin g code of  8045B deciphe rs to be:
     8   = 1998
     045 = The 45th day of the yea r or Februar y 14th.
     B   = A pla nt code.
    Thus 8045B is Febr uary 14th, 1998.
     GENER AL MILLS:
    The manufact uring date is code d to their fiscal year that begins on
    June 1st and  ends on May 31st.
    Interp ret the code  as follows:
    The first characte r of the cod e is a lette r and represents the
    month the product was made.
    The second charact er in the code is a number which represents the
    year the pro duct was mad e.
    The followin g two characters are num bers that represen t the day of
    the month the prod uct was made .
    The remainin g characters following identif y plant location and
    shift information.
     Examp le:  A packi ng code of  E731B would translate as follo ws:
     E  = Octobe r
     7  = 1997
     31 = 31st day of the month
     B  = A plan t location    The followin g is their 12 mont h cycle.  The lett er ""I"" is not used
    becaus e it can be confused with the number ""1"".
     A = June       E = Octo ber         J = February
     B = July       F = Nove mber        K = March
     C = August     G = Dece mber        L = April
     D = Septemb er  H = Janu ary         M = May
     HANOV ER FOODS CORP.
     Small  whole potatoes, green beans, corn, etc.
     A fiv e digit code on the bott om of the can.  Omit the  first digit.
The next digit is the year.  The remaini ng three digits are the day of
the year the pro duct was pac ked.
     Examp le:  A code of 28304 deciphers to be:
     2   - disca rd this number
     8   = 1998
     304 = the 304th day of the year or October 31st
     Thus 28304 is October 31st, 1998
     HEALT HY CHOICE:
     First  character is a number, second is a letter  with the remainin g
characters being a lot ID.  The number is the year it was packed with
the letter being the month,  October = A, Nove mber = B, December  = C,
January = D, and  so on throu gh the year.  The recommended shelf life is
2 years.
     HORME L PRODUCTS
     Their  packing code is a lette r followed by five  numbers.  The
letter is their plant location and the numbers  are the dat ing code in a
MM-DD-Y format.
     Examp le:  A code of G07048 decodes to mean:
     G  = plant location
     07 = July
     04 = The fourth day of the month
     8  = 1998
     The can was  packed July 4, 1998 at plant location G.
     JELL- O BRAND PUDDINGS & GELAT INS
     The first four digits are the  date coding.  The first digit is the
year and the fol lowing three digits is the day  of the year .
     Examp le:  A packi ng code of 804522 10:38 deciphers as:     8     = 199 8
     045   = the  45th day of the year or Febru ary 14th
     22    = dis card the las t two digits.
     10:38  = the time it was packed.
     Thus 804522 10:38 means that box of puddi ng mix was packed on
February 14th, 1998 at 10:38  a.m.
     McCOR MICK HERBS & SPICE S:
(See also http://www.mccormick.com/info/oftenasked.html  )
     There  should be a four digit number of the bott om of the spice
package or extra ct bottle.  On foi l packages, it will be around the
outside edge.  This code is more complic ated than other manufact urers so
read closely.
     Examp le:  Using a numbe r 3604 as the pack ing code:
     To derive the yea r, take the first number and add 5 (3 + 5 = 8) so
1998 is the year  of manufact ure.
     To derive the mon th and day, divide the last three digits by 50
(604  50 = 6 with 4 remaining).  The six indicates the last whole or �
complete month before the month of produ ction, January, February , March,
April, May, and then June.  The next mon th, July, is the product ion
month.  The 4 remainin g is the day  it was prod uced.
     There fore a packi ng code of 3604 means that pro duct was pac ked July
4, 1998.
     While  not as prec ise, you can  save considerable time by just
finding the year .  The last three digits representing the day and mont h
will increase as the year grows.
     PROGR ESSO FOODS
     Canne d soups, beans, etc.
     Two lines of code  on top of the can .  The top line, the fir st two
characters are the dat e portion.  The first characte r is a lette r
indicating the month and the  second character is a digit indicat ing the
year.
     Examp le:  A packi ng code of L7N18 1211 (this is the first line)
would be:
     L   = 12th month or December
     7   = 1997
     N18 = ignor ed
     1211=  ignored.
     Thus a packing code of L7N18 1211 indicat es the can was pac ked in
December of 1997 .
     C. SHELF LIVES OF SOME COMMON STORAGE FOODS.     The chart given below has bee n adapted from a number of different
shelf-life charts published by the cooperative extension service s of
several states.  It presuppo ses no speci al packagings other than the way
the food comes from the stor e.  The gene ral assumpti on is that when a
given foods' taste, appearan ce or texture begin to take on notic eable
changes it has reached  the end of its best mar ketable shelf life and
should be rotated out.  This is not to say the  food is no longer edible,
but it is losing nutritional content at the same tim e so no purp ose is
served by keeping it for lon ger than is necessary to repla ce it with
fresher stock.  For what it' s worth, I'm not fully in agre ement with it
myself, but it's  a good working hypothes is and I modify it by my
personal experie nce which may vary  from yours.  If it is a dry food then
only dry utensil s should be used to remo ve it from its con tainer.  The
less light, moisture, heat and oxy gen it comes  into contact with, the
longer the food will keep.
         All of the below are for new, unopene d containers.

     E.2  SOFTWA RE SOURCES
[I have not used  any of thes e programs myself,  but I'm lis ting them for
those who might be interested - editor]
http://www.waltonfeed.com/grain/calc.html
    There are two Exce l spreadsheets here that can also be impor ted into
    Lotus 123, Quattro pro or Works  For Windows .  The first spreadsheet
    is a nutriti onal calcula tor showing the breakdow n of 65 nutr ients
    for 167 food s with more being importable.  The second spread sheet
    is a yearly supply calculator.
http://waltonfeed.com/self/plan.html
    A nutr itional calculator that allows you to ente r your food supply
    and it gives  you a daily  nutritional printout.  This is a smaller,
    less versati le version of the one from Rev elar below, but is less
    resour ce intensive and will run on a DOS only machine.
http://www.revelar.com/fsp.html
    A more  extensive, versatile version of the above program, makes it    much easier to modify for pers onal use.  It also  requires at least  a
    486, Windows  and 8mb of Ram.  A vers ion for the Mac is avail able as
    well.

F.  ORGANI ZATIONS
     F.1  THE CHURCH OF JESU S CHRIST OF LATTER DAY SAINTS
     The LDS chu rch, commonl y known as the Mor mon Church, has long had  a
welfare program for the bene fit of its members  in need.  Believi ng that
the best way to deal with the prob lem of needy  members is not to have
any, the church also strongl y encourages its members hip to be as
self-reliant and self-dependent as possi ble.  To fur ther this end it
provides access to church owned cannery facilities and mak es large,
economical bulk purchases of stora ge foods to sell at cost  to any memb er
with an interest  in starting  a personal food storage  program.  Believi ng
that the more self-dep endent people there are in general the few er there
will be needy in times  of hardship  the LDS chu rch also mak es those same
facilities and supplie s accessible to non-chur ch members, or ""gentiles"",
as well.
     Most facilities will be locat ed at one of the LDS Bis hop's
Storehouses located in vario us places around the cou ntry, but some
churches will also hav e their own local facilities.  The easiest  means
of finding  out is simp ly to ask the LDS church member you know.  If they
don't themselves know, or you don' t know any Mormons  then a little phone
book research will be necessary.  Find your nearest local Mormon church
and ask about speaking  with the local Bishop of the Ward or Reli ef
Society presiden t.  Either one of those two individu als will be able to
give you the inf ormation you seek.  Failing any of the abo ve, you can
also call the LDS chur ch headquarters in Salt Lake City at
1-800-453- 3860 extensi on 4164.
    Or you  can write to:
                   The  Church of Jesus Christ
                   of Latter-Day Saints
                   Wel fare Service s
                   Sev enth Floor
                   50 East North Temple Street
                   Sal t Lake City, Utah   84150     If you find  that you have a cannery  within striking distanc e then
give them a call.  Inquire about availab le times, what you  need to
provide and what  is not suit able for can ning.  Be up front  and honest
with them, they're sincere about allowin g non-church members to use
their facilities.  You'll hardly be the first one to want to talk to
them about food storage.  Ask for a copy of the cann ery guidelin es and a
price list of what is available.  There may also be classes or seminar s
available.  There is a certa in degree of varia bility between the
canneries so what is availab le at one may not be at another.
     I've corresponded with many LDS mem bers and hav e even contacted the
LDS headquarters in Salt Lak e City to get the official word.  Keeping in
mind that not every area may  have facilities for use  and that the fami ly
canneries are run by volunte ers, they are quit e earnest about allowing
non-church members to use their faciliti es.  It's worth investig ating.
IMPORTANT NOTE:    Please do keep in mind that the individ uals
                   res ponsible for the family canneries are all
*volunteers* with demands on their  time from many areas.  Be cou rteous
when speaking with the m and, if there are faci lities for use, flexible
in making arrangements to use them .  You will, of course, have to pay
for the supplies  that you use, can s and lids at the least, and any foo d
products you get  from them.  With the onset of the millenn ium the LDS
family cannery volunte ers are beco ming quite busy so be prepared  to have
to work with the ir available scheduling.  As a gener al rule they cannot
put your food in stora ge for you.  Be ready to pay for you r purchases in
advance, if nece ssary.  They do not take  credit cards and probably
cannot make change so take a check  along.
     Any food products  you want to have sealed in cans wil l need to fall
within their guidelines of suitabi lity for tha t type of packagin g.  This
is for rea sons of spoi lage control  since many types of foods just aren't
suitable for jus t sealing in a con tainer without further process ing.  If
you purchase food products from them, they wil l already be withi n those
guidelines.  A brief treatme nt of these guidelines may be found below.
     F.1.1  LDS FAMILY CANNERY GUIDELINES
     Subje ct to some variabi lity, the followin g foods are generally
available at the canneries:
Apple slices, dried          Macar oni                 Rice , white
Beans, pinto, pink,          Milk,  non-fat dry        Soup  mix
       gre at Northern        Oats,  quick rolled       Spag hetti
Carrots, dry                 Onion s, dry              Suga r, white
Cocoa, hot mix               Puddi ng mix              Whea t berries
Flour, white                 (choc olate & vanilla)    (har d red winter)
Fruit drink mix
     You will be able to purchase the necessar y cans, oxygen absorbers,
boxes and plastic lids for what you want  to can.
     The followi ng food items are not thought to store well when dry
pack canned and generally cannot be put up at the cannery:
Baked goods                  Egg noodles               Pean ut butter
Baking powder                Flour , whole wheat       Rice , brown     or soda                 Grano las                 Spic es
Barley, pearled              Honey                     Suga r, brown
Cereal, milled grain         Mixes , if they contain   Yeast
Coconut                       leav ening agents
Cornmeal                     Nuts,  roasted or raw
Dried meats                  Oils or fats
     Altho ugh I am not  in complete  agreement with the abov e list, it is
workable and wil l get the job done .  Make sure that the food you  want to
pack has little fat content and strive to make  sure it has a low
moisture content  and you sho uld be OK.  For grains, legumes, flours,
meals and dried fruits and vegetab les do make sure to use the oxygen
absorbers.  You should not assume the food is insect free.  When the
packets remove the ava ilable oxygen any insect life in the can will
either die or at least  go into sta sis.
G.  FOOD AND EQU IPMENT SUPPLIERS
     G.1  MAIL ORDERIN G STORAGE FOODS --
           WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW
     When it comes to building a food storage program, sooner or later
you may want to seriously consider  mail ordering at least a part of the
foods you want.  Even for those of us who try do as much as we can
locally there are some  things which are not going to be easily availab le
in our are as.  To help  with this I have included below a list of food
and equipment supplier s where just about anything can be found.
     Becau se many do find it neces sary or desi rable to purchase through
mail order I am including a few points which should be considered before
shelling out the  cash.
     1.-- Find out how  much the shipping  costs are going to be. Grains
and legumes are relatively cheap, but weigh a lot when bou ght by the
five or six gall on-bucket.  Becaus e of this, shippin g charges can
sometimes as much as double the actual cost of the product  by the time
you get it to your doo r.  Adding insult to injury is the $2.00 per rou nd
bucket fee UPS is char ging.  Compare carefully each company's list pri ce
and their shipping charges, combined, when dec iding who to order  from.
Saving up for a larger  order, or trying to find someone to combi ne
orders with might enable you to make a large enough order to get a price
break on shippin g.  You coul d also take a vacation in the area of the
company's location or swing through the area on the way back fro m one.
If you cho ose to do this, be certa in to call ahead and let  them know so
they'll have you r order ready and waiting for you.  The company in the
next state may be high er on the list pri ce, but end up being cheaper
than having it shipped  in from six  states away.
     2.-- Ask the supp lier when your ord er is going to ship.  Some
suppliers are way behi nd in order filling and you could be waiti ng and
waiting.  Slowne ss in shipping is not necessar ily a sign of bad
business.  Some suppliers may drag  their feet, but others may be
genuinely swamped by the vol ume of busin ess they are  receiving because
they have a good product at a fair price.  The closer we come to the
millennium the worse this problem is going to become.
     3.-- How fresh is the product  you are ord ering?  Freshness is whatit's all about when it comes  to storage foods.  If a food has a five
year shelf life in its container then you want  as much of those five
years to be on your shelf, not the  supplier's.
     4.-- Be ver y clear as to how the product you are orde ring is
packed.  Many supplier s offer identical foods packed in several
different ways.  Be certain the product number you are giv ing the
salesperson is for the  product packed in the manner in which you want
it.
     5.-- What is the head gas ana lysis?  If you are  ordering foods
packed in a nitrogen flushed  oxygen free container (with or with out an
oxygen absorber packet added) then ask about the lab oratory test results
that measure the oxygen content of the head gasses in the container.
This is of great  importance if you are countin g on the ext ra storage
life such packaging will giv e you.  There are but a few companie s such
as Perma Pak, Ready Reserve,  and Walton Feed that actually  produce
packaged storage  foods and most dealers only distrib ute and reta il their
products.  If the deal er can not produce  the manufac turer's test data
measuring the head gas ses of the product s they are selling  then keep
looking.
     6.-- If you  are purchas ing wheat and inte nd to use it prima rily for
bread making then be sure to ask about its pro tein content .  The best
breads need at least 12% pro tein and the  higher the better.  Also take a
close look at the weig ht of the product.   One company's five or six
gallon bucket of wheat  may not wei gh the same as another's.  The same
applies to dehyd rated foods such as frui ts, vegetabl es, TVP, etc .  Ask
about the moisture content of bulk  foods which are not alr eady package d
for long term storage.   10% moisture is where you want to be for grains,
legumes and most  everything else.
     7.-- What is the company's damage and ret urn policy?  If your
carefully packed SuperPails and #10 cans  get dented or cracked in
shipping you'll need to have  them replaced.  Most mail ord er companies
will require you to contact the shipper (such as UPS) for a claim
number.  The shi pper may or may not requ ire an inspe ction so don't
destroy any pack aging or containers until you know for sur e.
     Does anyone else know of anyt hing else a person  should look out for
or ask abo ut when mail ordering storage food?
     G.2  ADDRES SES OF SUPPL IERS
DISCLAIMER:   The addr esses listed below were either found by me or sent
              to me by the busines s owners or interested readers .  I
make *NO* representation as to their worthiness to do busi ness with.
Most of these merchant s or manufac turers have been in thei r field for
many years and will be aroun d for many more and are honorable in their
dealings.  However, there are some  businesses that spring up and then
disappear and with eve ry update of this work there is at least one or
two that I canno t locate from the previous update.  The advent of the
World Wide Web has onl y exacerbated this problem.  In addi tion to the
precautions mentioned in G.1 above you should take all of the usual
precautions in mail or phone  ordering.
     I hav e accumulated the following list of names and addresse s ofvarious supplier s of one thi ng or another relating to food  preservation
and storage.  They are  roughly categorized by type:
STORAGE FOOD MAN UFACTURERS:  The actual producers or packa gers of
storage foods.  Some also do retai l sales of their product s, but most do
not.
FOOD PRESERVATION DEALERS AND SUPP LIERS:  These are businesses dealing
with the aspects  of food pre servation as oppos ed to storage.  Canning,
meat curing, fermented milks, pickling, spices, soybean products ,
brewing, vintnin g, etc.
FOOD STORAGE AND PRESERVATION EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS:  The actu al
manufacturers of equip ment.  Some will do reta il sales and some do not.
DIATOMACEOUS EARTH MANUFACTURERS AND DEA LERS:  Self-explanatory.
STORAGE FOOD RET AIL DEALERS:   Retail sales of all of the above.
     Natur ally, addresses, phone numbers , web sites, etc change over
time so if you have more cur rent informa tion than I'm givi ng here,
please be so kind as to let me know.  Addition ally, I'm always looking
for new companie s so if you have some that I don't have I'd like  to see
those too.  Thanks - ed.

Introduction 
Spend any amount of time in the outdoors and you have probabl y found that mealtime is full of trade-offs. Do you choose 
foods that fuel your body or foods that sa tisfy your taste buds? Do you spend the extr a time to prepare a real meal or grab 
a protein bar on the go? Freezer Bag Cooking minimizes these trade-offs by changing the concepts of traditional outdoor 
food. It offers simplicity, convenience and variety. The cooking gear needed is minimal, lightweight and can be bought, 
found or even made. Meals are prepared at home and put into zip top freezer bags. When ready to eat, the meal is 
prepared in and eaten out of the freezer bag. Mealtime becomes fast, effortless and cleanup is as easy as licking your 
utensil and sealing the zip top bag. Also, with meals portioned into individual freezer bags, making meals for multi-day 
trips, families or a group is painless. 
Supplies Needed 
► A backpacking teakettle or lightweight pan with lid to bo il around 2 ½ to 3 cups water. Any metal is fine, and it 
doesn't need to be coated. 
► A simple canister or alcohol stove. A windscreen for y our stove made of a turkey pan, stove liner pan or heavy-
duty foil folded 3 times. This will increase fuel efficiency.  
► A spoon to eat with. Forks can be used ve ry carefully if eating pasta dishes.  
► A mug/cup with measuring markers on it (Lexan is clear so  you can use it as a measuring cup/drinking cup). Or a 
lightweight Titanium mug. Both work well for meas uring water, and are light, yet hold up to abuse. 
► A box of good quality freezer bags. Glad bags that are a greenish blue color or Ziploc bags. 
► A ‘cozy’ consisting of a piece of cloth to insulate the freez er bag (wool scarf, knit cap or other  suitable material). 
When getting ready to “cook” your meal, bring your water to a boil. Pour the water into your  cup, measure, then add it to 
your freezer bag. This way you avoid painf ul burns, adding too much water, or t ouching your freezer bag with a burning 
hot piece of metal-and having the small potential of melting t he bag. Stir with a Lexan or plastic spoon. After you have 
mixed it well, zip up the bag tightly and wrap in a fleece hat, jacket or cozy made for the purpose. Then let sit for 5-15 
minutes, make yourself a drink, stir real well, and eat. 
Put the freezer bag into a cozy before adding the water, this  works well as you don't have to hold the bag upright while 
adding the water. If you squeeze or knead your bags to mix up the food, be very careful- be sure you have pushed out all 
the air before you do this. The steam from  the hot liquid can cause a build up and your kneading could cause the bag to 
pop open. After your food is ready, roll the top 1/3 of the bag down (imagine you are cuffing socks). This will make your 
bag into it's own bowl. If you are planning on making soups in a cozy...it never hurts to  carry some instant mashed 
potatoes to thicken if it is too watery.  If you are making a lo t of rice dishes it doesn't hurt to carry a little extra instan t rice, 
in case it is too thin. Or add about 2-3 packets Parmesan cheese to help thicken.

Basic Cooking 
Rice Serving sizes: 1 person: 1 cup rice/1 cup water 
2 persons: 2 cups rice/ 2 cups water 
You can find white rice, premium white rice and brown rice 
in instant versions. I prefer the premium white rice, and I 
prefer Minute Rice brand.  Rice can handle sweet or savory 
flavors well. Rice should be put in a cozy for 5-10 minutes after you add boiling water. 
Couscous You can use either couscous in boxes or for a better buy, 
find it in bulk. Couscous is made from seminola, the same 
as pasta.  It is pasta, it  just doesn't need anything but 
boiling water to cook. You can find it in regular, whole 
wheat or in flavored varieties. 
Basic cooking method: 1 person: 1/3 cup couscous to 1/2 cup water 
2 persons: 3/4 cup couscous to 1 cup water 
To this you can add whatever flavorings, herbs or spices 
you might desire. A pinch of salt is usually mandatory with 
couscous. I always take salt packets with me to be sure. 
Couscous works well with either savory or sweet recipes-and handles items like nuts and dried fruit well. It does not 
do well though, with heavy thick sauces. Add your boiling 
water, stir well, and let sit for 5-10 minutes in a cozy.

Flood Preparedness and Response
STRATEGIES FOR FAMILIES
Floods are an inevitable and
natural part of life in Wisconsin,
especially for those who live
along streams and rivers.
Counties that border the
Mississippi and the Wisconsin
rivers are the most flood prone,
but serious floods have occurred
throughout the state. It is
important to be prepared and
know what to do before disaster
strikes.BE PREPARED
♦Find out if you live in a flood prone area. If you are new to the area,
ask your local public works or emergency government office about
local flood history. Ask whether your property is above or below the
flood stage water level.
♦If you live in a frequently flooded area, stockpile emergency building
materials. These include plywood, plastic sheeting, lumber, nails,
hammer, saw, pry bar, shovels and sandbags.
♦Plan and practice an evacuation route. Contact your local emergency
government office or local American Red Cross chapter for a copy of
the community flood evacuation plan. This plan should include
information on the safest routes to shelters. Individuals living in flash
flood areas should have several alternate routes to higher ground.
♦Have emergency supplies on hand.
a) Flashlights and extra batteries
b) Portable battery-operated radio and extra batteries
c) First-aid kit and manual; essential medicines
d) Emergency food, water, cooking equipment, can opener
e) Cash and credit cards
♦Develop an emergency communication plan. In case family members
are separated during a disaster because of work or school, choose a
long-distance relative or friend who can serve as the “family contact.”
After a disaster, it is often easier to call long-distance than to place a
local call. Make sure everyone in the family knows the name, address
and phone number of the contact person.
♦Make sure that all family members know how to respond after a flood
or flash flood. Teach family members how to turn off gas, electricity
and water; local authorities may request that you do so during a flood.
Teach children how and when to call 911, police and fire, and which
radio station to tune to for emergency information.
♦Keep the car fueled. Stations may not be able to operate because of
lack of electricity.
♦Learn about the National Flood Insurance Program. Most Wisconsin
communities participate in this program, which offers residents flood
insurance. (See the fact sheet “Insurance Coverage and Making a

more informationAFTER A FLOOD
Don't return home until
authorities have indicated it is
safe. When entering buildings,
use extreme caution. Potential
hazards include:
♦Gas leaks. Leave your home
immediately and call the gas
company if you smell the putrid
odor of leaking gas. Lanterns,
torches, electrical sparks and
cigarettes could cause an
explosive fire if there is a leak.
Do not turn on any light
switches.
♦Electrocution. Wear rubber
gloves and rubber-soled shoes
to avoid electrocution. Do not
turn on any lights or appliances
if the house has been flooded.
Turn off the electricity when
checking electrical circuits and
equipment or when checking a
flooded basement.
♦Structural damage. Watch for
falling debris and the possibility
of collapsing ceilings and
basement walls.
♦Food and water. Do not use
water or eat food that has come
in contact with floodwaters.

♦Listen to the radio for further information.
♦Fill bathtubs, sinks and jugs with clean water in case water becomes
contaminated.
♦Bring outdoor belongings, such as patio furniture, indoors.
♦Move valuable household possessions to the upper floors or to safe
ground if time permits.
♦If you are instructed by authorities, turn off all utilities at the main
power switch and close the main gas valve.
♦Join with neighbors and volunteers to put sandbags or other
protection in place. Stack sandbags away from the outside walls of
houses to prevent floodwaters from entering.
♦Do not attempt to walk through moving floodwaters. If they are
moving fast enough, water one foot deep can sweep you off your feet.
♦Do not attempt to drive over a flooded road. Turn around and go
another way.
DURING AN EVACUATION
♦Listen to the radio for evacuation instructions. If advised to evacuate,
do so immediately. Evacuation is much simpler and safer before
floodwaters become too deep for ordinary vehicles to drive through.
♦Follow recommended evacuation routes — shortcuts may be blocked.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionPreparing to Evacuate Your Farm
SAFETY MEASURES WHEN FLOODING IS EXPECTED
If you live in an area prone
to flooding or if flooding
has been anticipated for
some time, have an
emergency plan for
evacuation. It should
include such
considerations as family
safety, equipment safety,
livestock relocation and
temporary milking facilities.
When flooding is hours or
minutes away, keep your
priorities straight. Ensure
family safety first. Be
certain you have enough
time to get to higher
ground before access is cut
off. If you have time before
receiving an evacuation
order, a number of
precautions may help you
protect your property and
livestock.

Management AgencyLONG-RANGE PREPARATION
Take these precautions if flooding is common to your area or anticipated this
season:
♦Create an emergency plan of action, considering such things as areas of
high ground for animal relocation, temporary milking facilities and approval
to use them, equipment relocation and safe pesticide storage.
♦Be sure cattle are properly immunized before being exposed to floodwaters.
♦Arrange or be aware of standby services for emergency milk pick-up.
♦Have a plan for moving grain out of reach of floodwaters.
♦Provide riprap on banks of earthen manure storages where flowing water
may erode berms.
SHORT-TERM PREPARATION
If time is available, take the following precautions:
♦Move machinery, feed, grain, pesticides and herbicides to a higher
elevation. If you have a two-story barn, the upper level makes a good
temporary storage facility.
♦Open gates so livestock can escape high water.
♦If water is rising, try to drive stock through water free of obstructions.
Grazing animals swim well, but the greatest problem for them are fences
and other obstacles. Long swims through calm water are safer than short
swims through a swift current.
♦Leave building doors and windows open at least 2 inches to equalize
pressure and help prevent buildings from shifting.
♦If possible, move motors and portable electric equipment to a dry location.
♦Disconnect electric power to all buildings which may be flooded. If in
doubt about how to disconnect power, call your utility company.
♦Tie down lumber, logs, irrigation pipes, fuel tanks and other loose
equipment or material. Secondary containment is another possibility for fuel
tanks, as well as pesticide storage.
♦To keep surface water out of your well, use materials such as heavy plastic
and duct tape to seal the well cap and top of the well casing.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative Extension FLOOD-FARMPREPARATIONPesticide Storage Concerns During a Flood
PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE
Safe pesticide storage is of
critical importance in both
everyday and disaster situations.
Not only can improperly stored
pesticides pose significant
hazards to humans, but they can
do great harm to the
environment, including surface
water and groundwater
contamination. Combined with
floodwaters, pesticides can
create a widespread health
problem by threatening drinking
supplies.
For all of these reasons, take
preventive measures to minimize
storage quantities and potential
exposure to floodwaters. Take
extra precautions if you live in a
floodplain or expect flooding. If
flooding of pesticides occurs, be
sure you follow safe, legal
methods for emergency
response, containment and
clean-up.PREVENTION
♦Choose a safe location. If at all possible, locate pesticides in an area
where flooding is not likely. A good location will be downwind and
downhill from sensitive areas, such as homes and play areas, ponds or
streams.
♦Update your pesticide storage design. Contact your local Extension
agent or the Midwest Plan Service for modern pesticide storage plans.
Safety is a major criterion in new designs, as well as efficiency for
farmers. Features may include a mixing and loading pad, a drainage
system to collect contaminated runoff, a worker safety area and a
separate area for your personal protective clothing and equipment.
♦Keep pesticide storage to a minimum. The fewer pesticides on site,
the less you have to worry about. Consider the following:
a) Contract to have pesticides applied. This eliminates storage and
most liability concerns.
b) Clean out existing inventories. If a pesticide is still registered for
use, give it to a producer who can legally use it. If it is no longer
registered, dispose of it at a county Agricultural Clean Sweep
program.
c) Purchase only enough pesticide for a single season.
♦Take extra care with water-permeable containers. Dry formulations
packed in paper bags, fiber drums, cardboard boxes or similar
containers should be stored on metal shelves. Do not store liquid
pesticides on shelves above dry formulations.
♦If flooding is imminent, move pesticides (especially those in unsealed
or water-permeable containers) to a higher storage location. Use
caution in moving containers — wear protective gear as necessary.
♦Develop an emergency response plan in case of a leak, spill or fire.
Because of hazardous substances on you farm, you may be required
to develop a plan under the Superfund Amendments Reauthorization
Act (SARA) Title III. SARA requires farmers who have any of 360
extremely hazardous substances at 500 pounds or the threshold
planning quantity to alert the State Emergency Response Board
(SERB) with a Planning Notification Fee Statement. An off-site plan
identifying the substances and their location on the farm must be
developed with final plan copies sent to the local fire department,
your Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and SERB.
Contact the Wisconsin Division of Emergency Government for more
information.

POISONING
Be aware of any illness arising
after handling pesticides or
pesticide wastes. Acute
symptoms of poisoning
frequently include headache,
nausea, diarrhea, visual
disturbances, excessive
salivation or sweating, difficulty
in breathing, weakness, tremors
or convulsions. Acute symptoms
usually appear immediately or
within a few hours after
exposure. See a doctor
immediately or contact your
local poison control center if
symptoms appear.

“SARA Fact Sheet for Farmers,”
available from the Wisconsin Division of
Emergency Government.IF FLOODING HAS OCCURRED
If you suspect flooding of pesticide storage areas, use great caution in
investigating the immediate area — floodwaters may be contaminated with
pesticides. Wear appropriate protective clothing, particularly safety boots,
to avoid exposure.
If a release of pesticides has occurred, you are required by the Wisconsin
Spill Law to notify local and state authorities. Local authorities include
your Local Emergency Planning Committee. You can meet state reporting
requirements by calling the Wisconsin Division of Emergency Government
Spill Hotline at (800) 943-0003. This hotline is available 24 hours a day, 7
days a week. The duty officer at the Spill Hotline or your LEPC can help
you determine if federal notification is needed.
Emergency hotline personnel will gather information about the pesticide
release and make response decisions. Emergency response professionals in
your area will be notified to serve as the first responders to the flood site,
as necessary. Some possible scenarios:
♦For minimal flooding or leakage from paper containers, officials may
provide you with specific clean-up instructions. For example, you may
be asked to place the water-damaged pesticide into a secondary waste
container and to dispose of it at the next Agricultural Clean Sweep
event.
♦If moderate flooding has occurred, containment and clean-up may be
feasible.Area emergency response professionals may be sent to the
site. Technical guidance from the DNR and the Wisconsin
Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection will be
provided, as necessary.
♦If major flooding has already occurred, containment may be
impossible and clean-up minimal. Check your storage inventory to
determine if product is missing. If so, inform your LEPC about types
of pesticides and approximate amounts removed by floodwaters.
CONTAIN THE AREA
Take steps to prevent further release of the pesticides if possible and
feasible. Put smaller containers that are leaking into larger containers.
Wear protective clothing and equipment so you do not needlessly expose
yourself to the material in the process of stopping the spill.
At the same time the leak is being controlled, contain the spill material to
the area; if possible, construct a dam to prevent the chemical from
spreading.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionBuilding Dikes to Prevent Flooding
HOW TO FILL AND POSITION SANDBAGS
Standing water from melting
snow or heavy rains can flood
basements and damage yards,
wells, feed supplies, machinery
and other property. Flooding is
more apt to occur in areas with
poor surface drainage,
malfunctioning drainage systems
or ice dams.
A 1- to 3-foot-high sandbag or
earth dike offers protection from
shallow flooding (water depth
less than 3 feet). Contact a
construction firm, lumberyard or
your county emergency
government office for
information on where to obtain
sandbags.SITE SELECTION
Select the site for the dike, making the best use of natural land features to
keep it as short and low as possible. Avoid trees or other obstructions
which would weaken the structure. Do not build the dike against a
basement wall. Leave about 8 feet of space to maneuver between the dike
and buildings. Remove ice and snow, down to the bare ground if possible,
from the strip of land you've selected.
SANDBAG NEEDS
The number of bags required for 100 linear feet of dike is as follows:
♦800 bags for 1-foot-high dike
♦2,000 bags for 2-foot-high dike
♦3,400 bags for 3- foot-high dike
FILLING AND POSITIONING SANDBAGS
See diagrams on the back side. If you are building the dike on a lawn you
may omit the bonding trench shown in the diagram on Stacking Sandbags.
♦Fill bags approximately half full of clay, silt or sand. Do not tie.
♦Alternate direction of bags with bottom layer lengthwise of dike. Lap
unfilled portion under next bag.
♦Tamp thoroughly in place.
♦Build the dike three times as wide as high. For example, if the height
is 3 feet, make the base 9 feet.
SEALING THE DIKE
Seal the finished dike to increase its watertightness. To seal the dike:
♦Spread a layer of earth or sand 1 inch deep and about 1 foot wide
along the bottom of the dike on the water side.
♦Lay polyethylene plastic sheeting so the bottom edge extends 1 foot
beyond the bottom edge of the dike over the loose dirt. The upper
edge should extend over the top of the dike. This sheeting is available
from construction supply firms, lumberyards and farm stores. It
should be about 6 mils thick. It comes in 100-foot rolls and is 8 or 10
feet wide.

will then make the plastic conform easily with the sandbag surface. If
the plastic is stretched too tightly, the water force could puncture it.
♦Place a row of tightly fitting sandbags on the bottom edge of the
plastic to form a watertight seal along the water side.
♦Place sandbags at about 6 foot intervals to hold down the top edge of
the plastic. Place boards or dirt between these sandbags to prevent
winds from disturbing the plastic. As you work, avoid puncturing the
plastic with sharp objects or by walking on it.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionProtecting Livestock During a Flood
GUIDELINES FOR SAFE SHELTER AND EVACUATION
Unconfined livestock can usually
take care of themselves during
floods. Do not let them become
trapped in low-lying pens. A
number of safety precautions, as
outlined at right, can be taken
for animals housed in barns
during a flood. Above all, be
sure animals are evacuated
before floodwaters enter barns
and other enclosed livestock
areas. Animals sometimes refuse
to leave during a rapid rise of
water and may drown.
Additional resources:
Weather-reporting services, such as the
National Weather Service, to predict the
severity of flooding; your local
emergency government office; your
county agricultural agentKEEPING LIVESTOCK HIGH AND DRY
In broad, level flood plains where floodwaters are seldom deeper than 3 or
4 feet, you may need to construct mounds of soil on which livestock can
stay until floodwaters recede. Try to locate the mounds where they will not
be washed away by fast-flowing water.
THINK ESSENTIALS, SAFETY IN BARNS
♦Provide feed and water. Water is essential. Thirsty animals will try to
break out to get to floodwaters. If clean water is in short supply, limit
feed intake.
♦If animals are housed with machinery, fasten bales of straw in front
of sharp edges and protruding parts such as cutter bars or crank
handles.(Do not use hay, because animals will eat it.) Try to cover
wooden paddle wheels on combines or choppers, since these parts can
be dangerous.
♦Block off narrow passageways where animals would be unable to turn
around. A few heavy animals in a narrow dead end can be dangerous
both to themselves and the building.
♦Be absolutely certain that herbicides, pesticides and treated seeds are
not even remotely accessible to livestock, and are stored where
floodwater will not contaminate livestock feed or water.
♦Turn off electricity at the main switch. Livestock could damage
electric fixtures, causing fires or electrocutions.
♦If there is a possibility that dairy barns may become inundated, drive
cattle out of the barn. During rapid rise of water, cattle often refuse
to leave the barn and may drown inside if the water rises high
enough. For this reason, begin evacuation measures before a state of
emergency.

“Standby Power,” Illinois Farm
Electrification Council, Fact Sheet #2.LOCATION AND SAFETY FEATURES
♦Large engine generators should be located in a building, preferably a
heated building.
♦Inlet and outlet air ducts must be large enough to carry off excess
heat. They should be open at least a half a square foot for each 1,000
watts of generator capacity.
♦Combustion fumes must be carried outdoors safely. Exhaust pipes
must be at least 6 inches from combustible material.
OPERATION
An automatic standby unit should start automatically when power fails, and
stop when power is restored. When using an engine-driven generator with
a manual start, or when using a tractor driven unit, follow this procedure
when power fails:
♦Call your power supplier and advise them of the conditions.
♦Turn off or disconnect all electrical equipment.
♦Position the tractor or engine for belt of PTO drive.
♦Start the unit and bring the generator up to proper speed (1,800 or
3,600 rps). Check on arrangement to carry off exhaust fumes. Be sure
there is no danger of fire. The voltmeter will indicate when the
generator is ready to carry the load.
♦Put the transfer switch in the generator position.
♦Start the largest electrical motor first, adding other loads when each is
up to operating speed. Do not add too much too fast. If the generator
cuts out for any reason, repeat the second, third and fourth steps
above.
♦Check the voltmeter frequently. If voltage falls below 200 volts for
240 volt service or below 100 volts for 120 volt service, reduce the
load on the generator by turning off some electrical equipment.
♦When commercial power is restored, put the transfer switch in normal
power position. Then stop the standby unit.
MAINTENANCE
♦Keep the unit clean and in good running order at all times so it will
be ready for immediate use. Dust and dirt accumulations on the motor
can cause it to overheat when operated.
♦Follow maintenance instructions in manufacturer's manual. A short
operation at set intervals will keep the engine in good operating
condition. Regularly scheduled warm-ups are necessary to keep a
standby engine in working order.

b) Installing a false floor over the basement slab. This allows water
to drain under the false floor to a drain or sump.
c) Installing a surface drainage system around the perimeter of the
basement floor. This method channels water from the walls to a
drain or sump for removal.
♦Relieving water pressure against walls and the floor. Some form of
drainage is necessary when cracks occur because of water pressure.
a) If the basement or foundation does not already have drain tile
installed, consider an excavation of the home exterior to allow for
waterproofing of the walls and the installation of washed stone
(gravel) and drain tile. Drain tile can divert water away from the
house if there is a slope, or accommodate a sump pump system as
noted below.
b) Internal drainage is another option if excavation is not possible or
convenient. Washed stone and drain tile are installed around the
interior perimeter of the basement footing. This requires subfloor
installation and trenching.
c) Sump pumps are a necessary part of the internal drainage system
unless the interior tile can be connected to exterior tile that will
drain away from the house. Similarly, sump pumps may be a
necessary part of external drain tile systems if water does not
drain away from the house naturally.
♦Filling the basement. This option can eliminate the groundwater
problem, but the trade-off is the loss of a full basement. If the
groundwater level in a basement is only 1 or 2 feet, one option is to
pour a new floor in at a higher level, leaving a crawl space in the
basement. The original floor needs to be broken first, so that water
pressure can be relieved. Fill dirt is brought in and the new floor
poured. Drainage under the new floor also is recommended. In more
severe cases, the basement may have to be completely abandoned.
♦Rebuilding septic systems and wells. If septic systems and wells have
been compromised, the systems should be rebuilt following modern
guidelines for high groundwater areas. There may be added expenses
related to closing or removing portions of existing systems that have
failed.
♦Raising or relocating the house. This is the most expensive option. It
is the best long-term solution when the building integrity is threatened
and utilities must be shut off. In some cases, it may be the only
reason-able option to avoid property damages and lower property
values.

areas that have moved out of vertical alignment. When this condition
is minor, you need not repair the wall immediately. However, any
noticeably buckled wall will eventually collapse from normal ground
pressures and seasonal temperature changes. When buckling has
seriously weakened the wall, the damaged parts should be rebuilt
immediately. Pilasters (vertical reinforcements) may need to be
constructed into walls over 15 feet long.
♦Settled walls and footings are indicated by vertical cracks either in
small areas or throughout the structure. Repairs are difficult without
special equipment. Contact a reliable contractor for this work.
♦Heaved floors are those that have not returned to their original level
or have cracked badly. The floor may have to be removed and a new
floor constructed. If a floor is badly cracked, but has returned to its
original level, a new floor may be placed over the old one. A vapor
barrier should be added between the two floors. The new floor should
be at least 2 inches thick.
In houses without basements, the area below the floor may be completely
filled with mud. Shovel out the mud as soon as possible to avoid rotting
joists or foundation wood.

SAFELY CLEANING A FLOOD-DAMAGED HOME
Clean-up priorities will vary
depending upon the kind and
seriousness of damage to your
home. But assuming major
concerns such as structural
safety, basement flooding, and
electrical and water systems
have been addressed, clean-up
can begin inside.
Start cleaning your furnishings
as soon as possible. Your aim
should be to thoroughly dry and
clean the house before trying to
live in it or have permanent
repairs made. Early efforts
should include taking furniture,
rugs, bedding and clothing
outside to dry and prevent
mildew.SET PRIORITIES AND KEEP SAFETY IN
MIND
As you begin clean-up, focus on accomplishing the most important tasks
first. Resist over-exerting yourself.
♦Give special attention to cleaning children's toys, cribs, playpens and
play equipment. Boil any items a toddler or baby might put in his or
her mouth. Discard stuffed toys, water-logged toys and non-cleanable
items.
♦Keep chemicals used for disinfecting and poisons used for insect and
rodent control out of children's reach.
♦Wear protective clothing on legs, arms, feet and hands while cleaning
up debris.
GENERAL RULES FOR CLEANING AND
DISINFECTING
♦Wash exposed skin frequently in purified water. Wear rubber gloves
to protect against contamination and skin irritation.
♦Try using a pump-up garden sprayer or hose to remove layers of mud
from hard surfaces.
♦Scrub with a household cleaner/detergent solution and a brush to
remove remaining surface oil. Rinse with clean water.
♦Wash with a disinfectant, such as chlorine bleach, pine oil or a
phenolic product, such as Lysol. Remember, a product is considered

GENERAL CLEAN-UP AND WHAT TO DO BEFORE THE ELECTRICIAN
ARRIVES
Restoring the electrical system
and evaluating damage to
appliances are high priorities
after a flood. But before your
electrical system is turned on, it
should be thoroughly checked
for short circuits by an
electrician or other competent
person. Ask your power supplier
for advice and assistance.
Before entering your home after
the flood, be sure that the
electricity has been completely
shut off. Appliances should not
be operated until they have been
thoroughly cleaned and
reconditioned. Running
equipment before it is properly
cleaned could seriously damage
it and may cause electrical
shock.ELECTRICAL CIRCUITS AND EQUIPMENT
Things to do before the electrician arrives:
♦Have electricity shut off at both the meter and in the buildings. When
touching switches, stand on a dry board and use a dry stick or rubber
gloves to pull handles.
♦Remove covers from all switches, convenience outlets, light outlets
and junction boxes that have been under water.
♦If a box is filled with mud, remove the screws that hold the receptacle
or the switch in place. Pull receptacle, switch and wires out about two
inches from box. Clean out all mud and dirt. Do not remove electrical
connections. Leave boxes open for electrician.
♦Remove all fuses and covers from entrance panel. Clean out all mud.
Wires can be moved, but do not disconnect.
For some equipment, such as pumps, a temporary line can be installed by
an electrician until the permanent wiring has a chance to dry.
ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES
Here are some general rules to follow:
♦Television sets and radios. Professional cleaning is recommended for
these types of appliances. There is a danger of shock because certain
internal parts can store electricity even when the appliance is
unplugged. Check the back for a warning label. Get a cost estimate
before repairs to see if the appliance is worth saving.
♦Motorized appliances. These include the washing machine, dryer,
dishwasher and vacuum cleaner. Professional cleaning of the motor
and other parts is recommended. However, you can clean the exterior
surfaces in the meantime.
a) Use a heavy-duty cleaner and hot water to remove stains and silt
deposits. Follow up with a rinse solution of 2 tablespoons chlorine
bleach to each quart of water.
b) When removing gritty deposits, rinse your cloth in water
frequently to avoid scratching enamel or metal surfaces.
c) Clean and disinfect dishwashers, washing machines and dryers
only with water that has been declared safe to drink.

""Repairing Your Flooded Home,"" the
American Red Cross/Federal
Emergency Management Agency, 1992.♦Refrigerators, freezers and ovens. These appliances may have foam
insulation and sealed components that suffer little water damage. But
since they hold food, they should be cleaned, disinfected and checked
by a professional or replaced. If replacement is recommended, get the
opinion in writing and discuss it with your insurance adjuster before
money is spent for a new appliance.
♦Heating appliances. Disconnect hot water heaters and remove all
panels and any flood-soaked insulation. Have an electrician or
professional repair person clean and restore the unit to working order.
♦Lights and lamps. Remove fixtures that were submerged. Clean outlet
boxes, sockets and wiring. Floor or table lamps should be completely
disassembled and cleaned. Damaged cords and plugs should be
replaced. Consider taking lamps to an appliance shop unless you are
familiar with these repairs.
GROUNDING
All metallic appliances that have been flooded should be properly
grounded to prevent electric shock. Mud or dirt in a grounded outlet or
adapter may prevent the grounding system from working, and you could be
electrocuted. If you are unsure if your electrical system is properly
grounded, call an electrician.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionUniversity of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionRestoring Heating Systems After a Flood
ASSESSING DAMAGE AND GENERAL CLEAN-UP
Any heating system exposed to
flooding should be
professionally inspected,
cleaned and reconditioned
before reuse. Floodwater may
have damaged heating
equipment and undermined
chimneys. If chimney cracks or
leaks go unrepaired, your family
is at risk of fire or
carbon-monoxide poisoning.
Ask the service person if there is
anything you can do to help
before his or her arrival. Usually
this will include turning off fuel
and power to flooded units as a
safety measure, and removing
mud and debris from the furnace
housing and inside the chimney.
Leave things like inspection of
oil storage tanks and cleaning of
motors, blowers and other
flooded parts to the
professional. Flood insurance
and federal disaster assistance
programs usually will help
replace flooded gas and oil
appliances, including furnaces.OIL AND GAS SYSTEMS
In general, any flooded parts should be professionally inspected and
cleaned before turning the system back on. Check your owner's manual if
you are unfamiliar with the system.
♦If your furnace was flooded to the level of the burners, turn off the
valve on the pipe leading to it. If burners were hot when flooded,
parts may have cracked.
♦Modern furnaces also have an electrical switch for blowers. Turn this
off as well if any furnace parts were flooded.
OIL-BURNING SYSTEMS
♦Have the storage tank inspected by an experienced person to make
sure water and dirt have not entered.
♦Have the electric motor, burners, blowers, fuel pump and gears
cleaned and reconditioned by an expert. Flooded fuel filters should be
replaced.
♦Be certain that the fan motor, electric ignition systems and wiring are
completely clean and dry before you turn on the electricity.
♦If you have a hot water system, clean the fins on baseboard radiators.
Clean any wall radiators.
LIQUID PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS
SYSTEMS
♦Some natural gas systems may have a valve to the pilot gas line, in
addition to the main fuel valve. Turn both off if this is the case.
♦Have a service person:
a) Check to see if water leaked into the controls or pressure
regulator.
b) Clean and recondition all flooded equipment, including burner
elements, electric controls and regulators.
c) Replace severely flooded electric blower motors.
♦If you smell natural gas — which has a distinctive, putrid odor —
leave your home and contact your utility company or a service
person. Do not use open flames in the area.

Pamphlets on heating systems from
your local utility company.ELECTRIC SYSTEM
Electric heating systems are part of electrical wiring system clean-up.
Many local codes require that a licensed electrician do the work, or that a
municipal inspector check the system before you turn the power back on.
If power isn't shut off to a flooded furnace system, shut the main switch
off at the meter or remove the fuse to the furnace. (When touching
switches, stand on a dry board and use rubber gloves or a dry stick to pull
handles.)
Clean mud and debris from electric baseboard heating fixtures, being
careful not to damage heating equipment. Have a professional handle
cleaning and reconditioning of all working parts.
CHIMNEYS
A cracked, clogged or leaky chimney can cause fires or carbon monoxide
poisoning. Be sure you check your chimney for dirt, debris and leaks
before lighting the furnace or a fire. If flood damage has occurred, have a
mason do an inspection and make repairs.
♦Most chimneys have a foundation in the ground. If the chimney looks
like it has settled or tilted, examine the footing to see whether it has
been undermined.
♦Have the chimney rebuilt if it has settled badly or is broken where it
passes through floors or roof.
♦If mortar in the joints between bricks has disintegrated, have a mason
rejoint the chimney with cement.

REMOVING MOISTURE, CLEANING AND REPAIRING
Be prepared to let
flood-damaged walls, ceilings
and floors dry for several weeks.
If restoration work is completed
before proper drying, mold and
mildew will continue to grow.
The result may be structural
damage to your home, the need
to repaint walls or replace new
wall coverings, and discomfort
or illness to family members
who have allergies.GETTING THE MOISTURE OUT
Remove all water as soon as possible from your home. Also remove
furnishings that are water soaked. Once water is removed, the next step is
removing moisture that has been absorbed by wood, plaster and other
materials.
If the weather permits, open doors and windows to remove moisture and
odors. If the outside humidity becomes greater than inside, close things up;
likewise, close up the house overnight if temperatures drop and moist air
might otherwise be drawn indoors. If windows are stuck tight, take off
window strips and remove entire sash. If doors are stuck, drive out door
hinge pins with a screwdriver and hammer, then remove.
Consider using dehumidifiers to speed up drying when outside humidity
levels are high. If possible, rent commercial dehumidifiers, which remove
three to four times more water than home models. When using
dehumidifiers, shut windows and doors. If there is severe flooding in your
home, consider hiring a contractor for water removal. Some companies can
dry homes in less than a week with commercial dehumidifiers and air
movers.
WALLS and CEILINGS
Wash out mud, dirt and debris as soon as possible with a hose and mop
cloth or sponge.
Start cleaning from the top floor or upper limit of flooding and work
downward.
Remove wallboard, plaster and paneling to at least the flood level.
Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. If soaked by contaminated
floodwater, it can be a permanent health hazard and should be removed. If
most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4-
to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a
“chimney effect” of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw
with a metal cutting blade works well, but use only the tip of the blade and
watch out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.
Plaster usually does not need to be replaced, though it will take a very
long time to dry.
Some paneling may be salvaged if allowed to dry slowly. You also should
remove and dispose of any flood-damaged insulation, which will hold
water for months after getting wet.
University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative Extension FLOOD-CLEAN-UP/REPAIR
more informationREMOVING MILDEW
To remove surface mildew on
walls or ceilings, use a mildew
surface cleaner (available at
paint stores) or: scrub the
mildew with household
detergent, then scrub with a
solution of one-quarter cup
bleach to 1 quart water. Rinse
well with clean water. Once fully
dry, apply a coat of paint
containing an anti-mildew agent.
To remove surface mildew on
floors and woodwork, use a
phosphate cleaning solution
such as powdered automatic
dishwashing detergent or
trisodium phosphate (4 to 6
tablespoons to a gallon of
water), available in hardware
stores. Rinse with water, and
when dry, apply a
mildew-resistant finish.

UW-Extension Publications–
“Removing Water From the Building
Materials of a Water Damaged Home;”
“High Humidity After Water Damage
and the Growth of Mildew and Mites.”To clean surfaces:
♦Thoroughly wash and disinfect walls, ceilings, exposed wall cavities
and studs.
♦Use a good disinfectant to prevent mildew build-up. One cup of
chlorine bleach mixed with a gallon of water works well. For a
soapier cleaning solution, add a half cup of mild detergent. Wear
rubber gloves.
♦If walls have already dried, work from the floor to the ceiling to
prevent streaking. (Dirty water splashed on dry walls may be
absorbed and become almost impossible to remove.) Overlap sections,
cleaning the ceiling last.
FLOORS
Before the house has dried out, scrub floors and woodwork with a stiff
brush, plenty of water, a detergent and disinfectant. Carpeting soaked by
contaminated floodwater should be removed and discarded unless it can be
sanitized at a commercial facility for a cost substantially less than
replacement. Vinyl flooring and floor tile may need to be removed to
allow drying of subfloor.
Wooden floors should be dried gradually. Sudden drying could cause
cracking or splitting. Some restoration companies can accelerate drying
time by forcing air through the fluted underside of hardwood floorboards.
ONCE FLOORS HAVE DRIED
Assess whether your floors can be repaired, replaced or recovered.
Consider your time and budget as you make any decisions. If hardwood
floors are damaged beyond repair, you may want to forego the cost of
replacement and instead cover them with carpeting, vinyl or linoleum. Or
you might lay a new floor over the old, rather than replace it.
♦Plywood subfloors may have delaminated (separated) from excessive
moisture, causing buckling. Sections may have to be replaced or have
new plywood nailed over them. Consult a contractor for this work.
♦If buckling or warping has occurred, drive nails where the floor tends
to lift or bulge. This will prevent further damage. Badly warped
hardwood floors usually can't be repaired. Warped, wide pine board
flooring, however, will often flatten out after it has thoroughly dried.
♦Plane or sand floors level. Do not refinish until thoroughly dry.

REMEDIES FOR INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR SURFACES
Walls must be dry from the
inside out before restoration,
repainting or recovering can
begin. Even when walls feel dry
to the touch, the material inside
the wall may be wet. Drying the
inside of the walls may take
weeks or even months. The total
drying time will depend partially
on the amount of dry air that can
circulate through the studding
and different wall materials.
Plaster and paneling can often
be saved, but you still need to
get air circulating in the wall
cavities to dry the studs and
sills. Wallboard soaked by dirty
floodwater will need to be
replaced. If the wallboard was
damaged by clean rainwater,
consider cutting a 4- to
12-inch-high section from the
bottom and top of walls. This
will create a “chimney effect” to
speed up drying time. A
reciprocating saw with a metal
cutting blade works well for this
task, but use only the tip of the
blade and watch out for pipes,
ductwork and wiring.GUIDELINES FOR WALL COVERINGS AND
INSULATION
♦Remove drywall, laminated paneling and plaster at least to the flood
level. Warping above the water level often occurs with drywall and
paneling, so more may need to be removed.
♦Plaster walls can sometimes be adequately drained by removing the
baseboard and breaking out plaster and lath at the bottom of the wall.
Later the baseboard can cover the opening.
♦Some paneling may be salvaged if allowed to dry slowly. Remove the
baseboard from paneled walls and pry off the individual sheets. Prop
them against the wall to dry. Don't allow them to dry in sunlight,
which may cause warping.
♦Remove vinyl-covered wallpaper. It will restrict drying within
flood-damaged walls.
♦Water-soaked insulation should be removed and replaced. It can hold
water for months, causing odor and decay problems. While wet it has
little insulation value.
♦Consider wainscoting as a restoration option if flooding is no higher
than 3 feet above the floor.
PATCHING PLASTER
Do not attempt to repair plaster until walls and inner walls (studding and
insulation) are completely dry. If walls were flooded extensively, you may
need to wait four to six weeks, or even several months, before attempting
repairs.
Drywall compound is the preferred method for patching plaster. It comes
in a variety of types with different drying times, shrinkage characteristics
and consistencies. Read labels to select the type you need.
REPAIRING EXTERIOR SIDING
♦Dry wall cavities from the inside if possible. (See previous section.)
♦Remove small section of siding to check conditions on the reverse
side. If crevasses are filled with silt, remove siding to water level and
clean. Silt left in crevasses will trap moisture, causing mold, decay
and peeling paint.

CHECKING SHEATHING
Sheathing is the material between studding and finish siding. Depending
upon the type of sheathing, replacement may or may not be necessary.
♦Wooden boards should dry slowly and some will warp. Re-nail
warped areas after they dry. Replace those that are too badly warped
to salvage.
♦Sheathing board is usually absorbent and difficult to dry. Replace any
that is disintegrating or separating.
♦Plywood will probably separate and must be replaced. Marine
plywood will not warp or separate, but is generally considered too
expensive to use in residential construction unless the building is
subject to frequent flooding.

SAFELY FIXING A WATERY PROBLEM
You may be anxious to stop a
roof from leaking, but don't risk
serious injury trying to inspect
or repair it. First, try binoculars
for a closer view. Next, check
the attic for a drip trail. Leaks
are rarely located directly above
the water spot on the ceiling.
When you find a leak in the attic,
push a nail, straw or wire
through it to help you or a repair
person locate it outside.
If rain continues to be a problem
and a repair person is
unavailable, follow the directions
at right for temporary relief. But
be sure that only a physically
able person gets on the roof for
these emergency measures.
Unsteadiness on the ladder or
roof can lead to severe injuries.

""Repairing Your Flooded Home,""
American Red Cross/Federal
Emergency Management Agency, 1992.TEMPORARY REPAIRS
Cover holes in the roof, walls or windows with boards, tarps or plastic
sheeting. Nail down plastic sheets or trash bags with strips of wood and
secure them with duct tape. If the holes are large, you may need to support
the plastic in the center to keep it from ripping from the weight of the rain.
If sections of the roof or floors are sagging, have a contractor or other
knowledgeable person brace weak areas. Improper bracing may increase
damage and the chance of injury, so do not attempt this work unless you
are experienced in structural repairs.
CAUSES OF LEAKS
Storm and wind damage are responsible for some roof problems. Others
are caused by defective materials, faulty construction or gradual
deterioration. Here are some common causes of leaks:
♦Defective flashing. Flashing is the sheet metal used in waterproofing
roof valleys, hips and the angle between a chimney and a roof. Wet
spots near a chimney or outside wall may mean the leak is caused by
defective flashing, narrow flashing or loose mortar joints. Look for
corroded, loose or displaced flashing on sloping roof valleys and at
junctions of dormers and roof.
♦Clogged downspouts or eaves. Check for choked downspouts.
Accumulated water or snow on the roof above the flashing may cause
a leak. Ice accumulations on eaves sometimes form ridges, which
cause melting snow to back up under the shingles.
♦Cracks and deterioration. Roofing (especially wood or composition
shingles) usually deteriorates first on southern exposures. Check
southern slopes for cracking or deterioration.
♦Holes.Missing shingles or holes in the roofing may be causing wet
spots. To find holes, check for a drip trail or spot of light coming
through in the attic. Stick a nail, straw or wire through the hole to
mark the spot on the outside.
REPAIRING LEAKS
Methods of repair will depend on the kind of roofing and the nature and
extent of the leak. Unless you are experienced, hire a professional roofer
for this work. Missing shingles should be replaced, holes repaired and
cracks filled. Whatever method is used, avoid walking on patched sections.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionCleaning Flood-Soiled Clothing and Bedding
WHAT TO SALVAGE AND HOW TO CLEAN IT
Unfortunately, cleaning
your flood-soiled clothing
and bedding is not the
same as doing the usual
family wash. Items need to
be sanitized as you wash
them. And your washing
machine may be
flood-damaged, making
machine washing out of the
question until you can get
to a laundromat or friend's
house. Nevertheless, you
can help prevent mildew
damage to clothes and
bedding by sorting and
drying items as soon as
possible.
Even if your washing
machine was not flooded,
avoid using it until you
know that the water is safe
enough to drink and that
your sewer line works.
Before you wash clothes in
the machine, run it through
one full cycle. Be sure to
use hot water and a
disinfectant or sanitizer,
such as chlorine bleach.CLOTHING
When cleaning flood-damaged clothing:
♦Separate wet items as soon as possible to keep clothing colors from running
together. Sort out clothing that should be drycleaned.
♦Take clothes and linens outdoors and shake out dried mud or dirt. Hose off
extremely muddy items to avoid clogging your drain when you wash. If
you don't have access to water, simply dry things out.
♦If possible, soak badly soiled items overnight in cold water and detergent.
Wring out and air dry if you're unable to machine wash right away.
♦Check the labels on clothes and linens, and wash them in detergent and
warm water if possible. Adding chlorine bleach to the wash cycle will
remove most mildew and will sanitize the clothing. Because bleach fades
some fabrics and damages others, use other sanitizers, such as pine oil
cleaners, as necessary.
♦If an item is still stained after washing, rewash before drying. Drying may
make some stains more difficult to remove.
♦Items to be drycleaned should be air-dried and taken to a cleaner as soon as
possible.
Furs and leathers are usually worth the cost of professional cleaning. If you want
to clean leather yourself, wash the mud off and dry the leather slowly. Keep it
away from heat or sunlight while drying.
BEDDING
Bedding should be hung out to dry as soon as possible. Once dry, brush off
excess soil and dirt. Pillows, while washable, usually should be discarded if
soaked with contaminated floodwater.
♦Sheets and pillow cases. Put sheets and pillow cases through two complete
washing cycles. Use diluted liquid chlorine bleach to help kill germs.
Follow your usual drying procedure.
♦Blankets. Put washable blankets (acrylic, cotton) through two complete
washing cycles. Air dry or use an automatic dryer at proper tempera-ture
settings. Put wool blankets through a drycleaning process either at a
commercial coin-operated facility or drycleaning plant. Shrinkage and the
difficulty of thorough cleaning make wool blankets troublesome to wash.
♦Quilts and comforters. Wash or dryclean depending on fiber content of the
bedding. Usually, it is best to wash cotton quilts.

As a general rule, inexpensive mattresses are not worth the expense of
professional sanitizing and reconditioning. They should be discarded.
♦In some cases, a good inner spring mattress may be worth the cost of
reconditioning. Get an estimate from commercial facilities.
♦If the outside of the mattress is only slightly damp, brush off surface
soil and wipe with a cloth wrung out of a solution of one cup
denatured or rubbing alcohol and one cup water.

Flood-Damaged Furniture and Appliances
DECIDING WHAT TO SALVAGE AND TIPS ON RECONDITIONING
Evaluating appliance damage is
a high priority after a flood. Have
a service person check flooded
appliances before you attempt
operation or invest a lot of time
in clean-up.
Deciding which furniture to save
may be a more personal issue,
especially if you have antiques
and other pieces with
sentimental value. Keep in mind
that you don't need to repair all
pieces of salvageable furniture
immediately. You can clean, dry
and store them in a warm,
well-ventilated place until you
have time to deal with them.APPLIANCES
Before entering a home after a flood, be sure that the electricity to the
dwelling has been completely shut off. (See the fact sheet, “Electrical
Systems and Appliances.”) Appliances should not be operated until they
have been checked by service personnel.
Here are some things that may need to be done:
♦Electrical motors may need to be reconditioned or replaced.
♦Wiring and fixtures need to be checked and cleaned. They may also
need replacement.
♦Before cleaning and sanitizing an appliance, be sure the motor is in
safe working order. It may not be worth the time to clean up the unit.
♦A rust inhibitor may need to be applied to all metal parts. Even
though an appliance may not have been submerged, rust can develop
from dampness in the air.
REFRIGERATORS AND FREEZERS
Sanitize the refrigerator or freezer if water has seeped in. Be sure the
motor and freezing unit are in safe working order and insulation is not wet.
Wet insulation means replacement may be necessary.
♦Remove and wash all shelves, crispers and ice trays. Wash thoroughly
with water and detergent. Rinse with a disinfectant solution.
♦Wash the interior of the refrigerator, including the door and door
gasket, with hot water and baking soda. Rinse with a disinfectant
solution.
♦Leave the door open for about 15 minutes to allow free air
circulation.
♦If odor remains, place several pieces of activated charcoal in an open
metal container, or use a commercial refrigerator deodorizer.
♦Wash the outside with a mild detergent and hot water.
LAUNDRY EQUIPMENT
After washers and dryers have been reconditioned, sanitize them as
follows:

♦Unplug the dryer and wipe the drum and door with a cloth dipped in
disinfectant solution. Rinse with a cloth dipped in clear water.
♦Leave the dryer door open until all parts are thoroughly dry —
preferably overnight.
FURNITURE
Before starting to salvage damaged furniture, decide which pieces are
worth restoring. Such decisions should be based on: the extent of damage,
cost of the article, sentimental value and cost of restoration. Antiques are
probably worth the time, effort and expense of restoration. Unless damage
is severe, you may be able to clean and refinish antiques at home.
♦Don't try to force open swollen wooden doors and drawers. Instead,
take off the back of the piece of furniture to let the air circulate. You
probably will be able to open the drawers after they dry.
♦Solid wood furniture can usually be restored, unless damage is severe.
It probably will need to be cleaned, dried and reglued. Wood alcohol
or turpentine applied with a cottonball may remove white mildew
spots on wood. Cream wood restorers with lanolin will help restore
good wooden furniture parts.
♦Wood veneered furniture is usually not worth the cost and effort of
repair, unless it is very valuable. If veneer is loose in just a few
places, you may be able to glue it adequately.
♦Upholstered furniture soaks up contaminants from floodwaters and
should be cleaned only by a professional. Get a cost estimate to see if
furniture is worth saving. Usually, flood-soaked upholstered pieces
should be thrown away unless they are antiques or quite valuable.

DRYING PAPERS AND BOOKS
Dry papers and books slowly for best results. Photocopy valuable papers as
a precautionary measure because flood-damage may cause rapid
deterioration. If you don't have the time to clean and dry them
immediately, consider putting them in the freezer to prevent mildewing.
Place wax paper between layers of paper bundles or books so they can be
separated easily when removed.
♦Wipe book covers with a solution of one part rubbing or denatured
alcohol and one part water.
♦Place books on end with leaves separated. When partially dry, pile
and press books to keep pages from crumpling. Alternate drying and
pressing until books are thoroughly dry. This helps prevent mildew.
Use a fan to hasten drying.
♦If papers and books are very damp, sprinkle pages with corn starch or
talcum powder to absorb moisture. Leave powder for several hours,
then brush it off.
♦For valuable books that are nearly dry, consider pressing the pages
with an electric iron set on low. This is a tedious process, but may be
worth the effort. Separate the pages to prevent musty odors.
♦Some chemicals help stop mold growth. Contact your county
Extension office for recommendations on use.
♦When books are thoroughly dry, close them and use C-clamps to help
them retain their shape. Wipe vinyl and leather book covers with a
light coating of petroleum jelly or leather or vinyl dressing.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionSalvaging Food After a Flood
SAFETY MEASURES IN THE KITCHEN AND GARDEN
Food that has come in contact
with floodwaters is generally
unsafe to eat. Floodwaters
usually carry a high load of
bacteria and filth with them, and
may contain oil or chemical
wastes as well. With the
exception of canned foods and
some produce, most food
touched by floodwaters should
be discarded.
The safety of garden produce
depends upon the type of
flooding and type of produce.
Follow the guidelines at right,
which also cover refrigeration
and freezer concerns when the
power is out. And remember:
When in doubt, throw it out.FLOODED ITEMS TO DISCARD
♦Fresh produce, meat, poultry, fish and eggs.
♦Opened containers and packages.
♦Submerged, unopened glass jars that have cardboard lid liners, such
as mayonnaise or salad dressing.
♦Submerged, unopened, home-canned jars with broken seals. To check
seal, remove ring and test the flat lid with fingertips. If the lid lifts
off easily, discard the food.
♦All food in cardboard boxes, paper, foil, cellophane or cloth.
♦Spices, seasonings and extracts, flour, sugar and other staples in
canisters.
♦Cans that are dented, leaking, bulging or rusted.
FLOODED ITEMS TO SAVE
Some fruits, vegetables, and unopened canned goods and glass jars of food
can be salvaged. Sanitizing, and in some cases, cooking is necessary for
safe use.
♦To sanitize cans and glass jars of food:
a) Mark contents on can or jar lid with indelible ink.
b) Remove labels. Paper can harbor dangerous bacteria.
c) Wash jars and cans in a strong detergent solution with a scrub
brush.
d) Immerse containers for 10 minutes in a solution of 2 tablespoons
chlorine bleach per gallon of room temperature water.
e) Allow containers to air dry before opening.
♦Citrus fruits should be washed, sanitized with a light bleach solution
(see above) and peeled before eating.
♦Potatoes, carrots, apples and other firm fruits should be sanitized,
peeled, if possible, and cooked before eating. Do not eat raw fruit or
vegetables, even if they have been sanitized.
WHAT ABOUT THE GARDEN?
Some garden produce may be salvaged. Sanitizing, peeling and cooking is
recommended. Follow these guidelines:
University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative Extension Flood-Sanitation
more informationPREVENTION IS THE KEY
If it's not too late, prevent
floodwater from coming into
contact with food by:
♦Raising refrigerators and
freezers by placing cement
blocks under their corners.
♦Moving food from low
cabinets.
♦Moving canned goods and
other food stored in the
basement to the upstairs.

pasture, your garden will take about a month to become clean. Don't eat
or preserve food during this time.
♦Ask if your local health department will test the garden soil for harmful
bacteria. It may be able to determine whether immature root crops are
safe.
♦Discard leafy greens such as lettuce, spinach and cabbage, as well as soft
berries. These are highly susceptible to bacterial contamination. Silt and
other contaminants may be difficult to remove from them.
♦Wash beans, peas, tomatoes, peppers and summer squash in water. Then
soak in a weak chlorine solution of 2 tablespoons chlorine bleach to a
gallon of water. Peel and cook them thoroughly before eating.
♦For underground vegetables such as carrots and potatoes, wash in water
and sanitize as above. Peel and cook them thoroughly before eating.
♦Produce with a protected fruit or impervious outer skin, such as peas,
melons, eggplant, sweet corn or winter squash, should be washed and
disinfected before the outer shell, skin or husk is removed. Then shell,
peel or husk the produce and cook if possible.
REFRIGERATION AND FREEZER CONCERNS
If the electricity is off to the refrigerator or freezer, follow these guidelines:
♦Discard refrigerated meats, seafood, milk, soft cheese, eggs, prepared
foods and cookie doughs if they have been kept above 40 degrees F. for
over two hours. Also discard thawed items that have warmed above 40
degrees F., with the exception of breads and plain cakes.
♦Discard any refrigerated items that turn moldy or have an unusual odor
or appearance.
♦Refreeze partially or completely frozen foods.
♦Cold but fully thawed, uncooked meat, fish or poultry should be checked
for off-odor. If there is none, cook and eat or cook and refreeze.
♦Discard combination dishes such as stews, casseroles and meat pies if
they are thawed.
♦Refreeze thawed (but cold) juices, baked goods and dairy items such as
cream, cheese and butter.
♦Do not refreeze thawed vegetables unless ice crystals remain. Cook and
use them if there are no off-odors.

SAFETY GUIDELINES AFTER A DISASTER
During a disaster such as a
flood, tornado or fire, kitchen
items easily can become
contaminated. Floodwaters may
contain silt, raw sewage, oil or
chemical wastes, while fires may
leave residues from toxic fumes
or fire-fighting chemicals. Before
using any item that has come in
contact with these substances,
follow the guidelines at right.

Take apart any item that can be cleaned in pieces. If possible, remove
handles from pots. If you have a dishwasher and the hot water temperature
is at least 140 degrees F., use a long wash cycle and heated drying cycle to
clean and disinfect dishwasher-safe items. Regarding other items, or all
items if you don't have a dishwasher, follow these steps:
♦Wash all items in a a strong detergent solution. Use a brush to
remove dirt. Rinse in hot water.
♦Immerse glass, porcelain, china, plastic dinnerware and enamelware
for 10 minutes in a disinfecting solution of 2 tablespoons of chlorine
bleach per gallon of hot water.
♦Disinfect silverware, metal utensils, and pots and pans by boiling in
water for 10 minutes. Chlorine bleach should not be used in this case
because it reacts with many metals and causes them to darken.
♦Air-dry dishes. Do not use a towel.
♦Discard and replace soft, porous plastic or wood items saturated by
floodwater, since they cannot be sanitized. These include baby bottles,
nipples and pacifiers.
♦If cupboards and counters come in contact with floodwater, clean and
rinse them with a chlorine bleach solution before storing dishes.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative Extension FLOOD-SANITATIONFlooded Private Sewage Systems
SAFETY, SANITATION AND CLEAN-UP CONCERNS
Flooding of a private sewage
system can be a hazardous
situation for homeowners. It may
lead to a back-up of sewage in
the home, contaminated drinking
water and lack of sanitation until
the system is fixed. While you
don't have control over rainfall
or flooding in your area, you can
prepare for high water problems
and respond appropriately to
emergency flooding.HOW PROBLEMS OCCUR
When flooding or saturated soil conditions persist, a private sewage system
cannot function properly.
Soil treatment systems for wastewater rely on aerobic (with oxygen)
regions to reduce the amounts of chemicals and living organisms (viruses,
bacteria and protozoa). When the soil is saturated or flooded, those
hazardous materials can enter the groundwater and your drinking water
supply.
PREPARING FOR FLOODING
If you are prepared when flooding occurs, your family can be safe and
your system should survive. To prepare for a flood you should:
♦Make sure all septic tanks are full of liquid. The high-water season is
not the time to have tanks pumped; empty tanks are buoyant and may
“pop” out of the ground during flooding.
♦Plug floor drains, if necessary, to keep sewage from backing up into
the basement. Floodwaters may still enter the basement through
cracks and seams, however.
DURING A FLOOD
♦Discontinue use of your private sewage system. Use portable toilets, if
possible, or use any large container with a tight-fitting lid for a
temporary toilet. Line the container with a plastic bag. After each use,
add chlorine bleach or disinfectant to stop odor and kill germs. If
necessary, bury wastes on high ground far away from your well.
♦Remember that a well may become contaminated during a flood.
Therefore, DO NOT DRINK THE WATER. Drink bottled water, or
disinfect water before drinking. Contact your local health department
for disinfection instructions.
♦Do not bathe or swim in floodwater. It may contain harmful
organisms.
♦Shut off power to a sewage lift pump if you have one in the house or
in a pump chamber (mound, in-ground pressure, at-grade systems).

UW-Extension publication “Care and
Maintenance of Residential Septic
Systems,” (B3583).AFTER THE FLOOD
♦Do not use the sewage system until water in the disposal field is
lower than the water level around the house.
♦If you suspect damage to your septic tank, have it professionally
inspected and serviced. Signs of damage include settling or inability
to accept water. Most septic tanks are not damaged by a flood since
they are below ground and completely covered. However, sometimes
septic tanks or pump chambers become filled with silt and debris, and
must be professionally cleaned. If tile lines in the disposal field are
filled with silt, a new system may have to be installed in new
trenches. Because septic tanks may contain dangerous gases, only
trained specialists should clean or repair them. Wisconsin code
requires licensed plumbers for any repairs.
♦Discard any items that are damaged by contaminated water and
cannot be steam cleaned or adequately cleaned and disinfected.
♦Do not pump water out of basements too quickly. Exterior water
pressure could collapse the walls.
♦If sewage has backed up into the basement, clean the area and
disinfect the floor with a chlorine solution of one-half cup of chlorine
bleach to 1 gallon of water.
♦Contact the county health department or county Extension office to
obtain a drinking water test kit. (See the fact sheet “Water
Contamination in Private Wells.”) Do not drink the water until it has
been tested and is safe.

SAFETY PRECAUTIONS AND ELIMINATION
Following floods, rats and other
rodents may move into buildings
to escape floodwaters. Snakes
are often forced into places
where they are not usually
found. Upon re-entering flooded
homes or buildings, you will
need to be wary of these
possibilities. Rats can carry
disease and parasites, while
snakes may be poisonous or at
least frightening. Neither pose
serious problems in Wisconsin,
but the chance of an incident
increases after a disaster.WHERE THE RATS ARE
Because of the danger of rat infestation, use caution when entering flooded
buildings:
♦Carry a solid club and a flashlight.
♦Inspect likely hiding places for rats. Check closets, drawers,
mattresses, appliances, upholstered furniture, stacks of clothes or
paper, dark corners, attics and basements.
♦Be extremely careful when approaching rats. They may be aggressive.
CONTROLLING RATS
If rats continue to be a problem after floodwaters recede, contact your
county Extension agent or professional pest control operator for advice. If
you proceed on your own be extremely careful with any rodenticide or
trap. To minimize rat problems:
♦Remove trash piles and piles of damaged furniture or equipment.
Store materials on platforms or shelves 12 to 18 inches above the
ground.
♦Remove food sources. Store food supplies in rat-proof bins or
containers. Suspend garbage containers from trees or posts. Remove
animal carcasses, as they may attract rats.
♦If you are bitten by a rat, wash the wound with soap and water and
see a doctor immediately. Rats may carry diseases and at the least, rat
bites can cause infection. If the rat is captured or killed, health
authorities may wish to check it for rabies or other diseases. When
picking up a carcass, use the inside of a plastic bag to avoid touching
it. Double-seal it in plastic and freeze until further notice.
INSPECTING FOR SNAKES
It is important to know what poisonous snakes may be common to your
area. Only two poisonous snakes exist in Wisconsin: the timber rattlesnake
and the massasauga rattlesnake. Both species are restricted to the southwest
quarter of the state. The massasauga is an endangered species and is rarely
encountered. Non-poisonous snakes, however, are common and may bite.
Remember that all snakes are beneficial to the ecosystem and should not
be killed indiscriminately — poisonous snakes included. But follow these
precautions upon entering a flooded structure or area:

around homes, barns, outbuildings, driftwood, levees, dikes, dams,
stalled automobiles, piles of debris, building materials, trash or any
type of rubble or shelter.
♦Keep a heavy stick or long-handled tool handy. After dark, carry a
strong light.
♦Before beginning rescue or clean-up operations, search the premises
thoroughly for snakes. Wear heavy leather or rubber high-top boots,
and heavy gloves. Use rakes, pry bars or other long-handled tools
when removing debris. Never expose your hands, feet or other parts
of your body where a snake might be.
♦Explain to children the dangers of snakes during storm or flood
conditions and the precautions they should follow. Do not allow
children to play around debris.
♦If you kill a poisonous snake, use a stick, rake or other long-handled
tool to carry it away for disposal.
♦If you realize you are near a snake, remain still—sudden movements
may cause the snake to strike. If the snake doesn't move away from
you after a few minutes, slowly back away from it.
♦If someone is bitten by a poisonous snake, call a doctor immediately.
If bitten by a non-poisonous snake, clean the wound and watch for
signs of infection.
CONTROLLING SNAKES
To minimize chances of finding snakes indoors, block openings where they
might enter buildings. Snakes can pass through extremely small openings
and usually enter near or below ground level. Some other suggestions:
♦Be sure doors, windows and screens fit tightly.
♦Search walls and floors for holes or crevices. Inspect the masonry of
foundations, fireplaces and chimneys. Then plug or cement these
openings.
♦Plug spaces around pipes that go through outside walls.
♦Fasten galvanized screen over drains or ventilators, or over large areas
of loose construction.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionSalvaging Stored Wet Feed and Grain
DRYING, MARKETING AND SAFE FEEDING
Time is of the essence in
salvaging wet feed and grain.
Both will begin to heat and mold
very quickly, leading to spoilage
as well as the possibility of
spontaneous combustion. As
soon as possible, you should
remove dry portions of grain and
store them separately. Dry bales
of hay should be removed and
restacked in a dry location, since
capillary action will draw water
up into the stack.
Wet feeds should be presumed
harmful to animals until tested.
They may contain contaminants
from floodwaters, as well as
mold spores which sometimes
produce dangerous toxins.USE DRYER IF POSSIBLE
If part of a grain bin has been flooded, remove dry grain from the top
using a vacuvator or any other means. Use one of the following methods
for handling wet grain:
♦Get the wet grain to a dryer quickly, if possible. This is the surest
way to save wet grain.
♦If the grain depth can be kept below 6 feet, use a natural-air bin
drying system with a perforated floor and a high-capacity drying fan.
Sup-plemental heat should only be used during periods of high
humidity. Do not raise the air temperature more than 10 or 15 degrees
F.
♦If a dryer is not available, spread the grain in as dry a place as
possible. Don't pile it any higher than 6 inches. Stir it daily to prevent
overheating and to speed drying. Watch for and remove molded
grains.
♦Wet grain can be ensiled if it is intended for feed and the moisture
content ranges between 25 and 35 percent. If using a conventional
silo, see your county agricultural agent about treating the grain with
proprionic acid to prevent mold.
DRY AND SHELL WET EAR CORN
Separate dry corn from wet and store it on high ground. If the ground is
wet, first cover the area with plastic or building paper. Handle wet ear corn
as follows:
♦Dry the corn if facilities and equipment are available. Remove corn
from crib, since mud and debris washed into the crib may make
drying difficult or impossible. Then place the ear corn over a drying
tunnel and force air through the corn with a fan.
♦Shell the corn if shelling equipment is available.
GUARD AGAINST HAY FIRES
Flooded hay should be disposed of or used on fields as a fertilizer. It is
probably unsafe for animals and not worth the time and expense of drying.
Because of hay's tendency to heat and mold quickly, it should be spread
out to aerate as soon as possible and turned often. Hay bales that are 30 to
40 percent wet pose the greatest risk of fire. Check hay storage often for
pungent odors, hot damp areas on the stack, emission of water vapors and
other signs of heating.
University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative Extension FLOOD-FARMRECOVERY
more informationREPLACING HAY WITH GRAIN
If you must replace conventional
roughage feeds with grain
because of flooding, consider
fibrous grains such as oats,
barley, ground ear corn or one
of the high-fiber byproducts
such as brewers grains, corn
gluten feed or soy hulls.
Continue to feed hay or straw
unless you have had experience
with high grain feeding. You
must maintain a minimum
amount of forage in cattle diets.
Check with your nutritionist or
county agricultural agent for
guidelines. Spread any major
changes in a feeding program
over a period of several days.
Observe animals carefully during
the transition.
Additional resources:
Consult your veterinarian or county
agricultural agent before using
flood-damaged feeds.♦To check a stack's temperature for fire risk, drive a sharp pointed pipe
into the hay, lower a thermometer inside the pipe, and leave it there
for about 20 minutes. At 150 degrees F., the hay is approaching the
danger zone. At 170 degrees F., hot spots or fire pockets are
possible. Have the fire department on standby.
FIND A LOCAL MARKET
If it is not possible to dry grain artificially, try to find a local market for it.
Usable flood-damaged grain must be sold at a salvage price, possibly to a
large livestock feeder who can use it before it spoils. Grain should be kept
in airtight storage to prevent spoilage.
SEED GRAIN AND SILAGE OFTEN A LOSS
Wet seed grain probably will not be suitable for seed, as wetness causes
the seed to germinate. Subsequent drying would stop germination and
likely kill the seed or reduce its viability. Do not feed seed grain to
livestock, since it may contain toxic additives.
Flooded silage likewise will be a loss. Its waterlogged state will hurt feed
value, as will any contaminants from the water. Like hay, it might be
spread on fields as a fertilizer.
SAFETY WITH WATER-DAMAGED FEEDS
♦Testing.Do not feed flood-damaged grains until they are tested for
mycotoxins, toxic substances produced by fungi. Ask your county
Extension agent for locations of testing laboratories. Even if the feed
is deemed safe to use, watch animals carefully for signs of illness.
♦Nutritive value. Mixed feeds, grains and roughages which have heated
or spoiled will have little nutritive value for livestock, depending on
the extent of the damage.
♦Safety.Do not feed heated, molded or sour feeds, or moldy legume
hays (such as alfalfa or clover) to any livestock. Reduced
performance, sickness, abortion or death may occur.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionMaintaining Livestock Health After a Flood
ISSUES OF DISEASE CONTROL AND SANITATION
If your fields or farm buildings
have been flooded, take special
precautions against flood-related
accidents or diseases in poultry
and livestock. Give animals extra
care, particularly if they have
been stranded by floodwater,
and have been off regular
feeding schedules. Keep fields
clear of harmful debris, and
clean buildings as soon as
possible. In addition, watch for
signs of flood-related diseases,
such as lameness, fever,
difficulty breathing, muscle
contractions or swelling of
shoulder, chest, back, neck or
throat. Be prepared to contact a
veterinarian if you spot trouble.DISEASE CONTROL
Following a flood there may be danger of infectious diseases in livestock,
but unless serious outbreaks of infection have occurred recently, the
situation should not be alarming. Observe these precautions:
♦Where large numbers of animals are assembled, watch for any
indication of infectious diseases such as pneumonia, foot rot or
leptospirosis. These diseases are more likely to occur where cattle are
crowded on wet ground and where horn flies and houseflies are
abundant.
♦Promptly report any sign of disease to a local, state or federal
veterinarian.
♦Contact a veterinarian about vaccinating animals for immunity from
flood-related diseases such as anthrax, blackleg and swine erysipelas.
FEED AND WATER
♦Provide clean, uncontaminated water.
♦Inspect feeds such as corn, wheat and hay. Do not feed
flood-damaged or moldy hay unless it has been tested for mycotoxins,
toxic substances produced by fungi.
♦Do not use any feed or forage that may have been contaminated by
chemicals or pesticides.
PASTURELAND
♦Standing water may have ruined some pastures. Lack of adequate
forage could force animals to eat poisonous plants. Remove fallen
wild cherry limbs from pastures to prevent livestock poisoning.
♦Before restocking flooded pastures, remove debris, especially along
fence lines and in corners. Livestock could be injured from pieces of
barbed wire, sharp metal and trash.
PROTECTING DAIRY COWS
♦Try to milk at regular times. It is better to lose the milk from one
milking than to stress high producing cows.
♦If you must use a neighbor's milking parlor, try to keep the two herds
separate.
University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative Extension FLOOD-FARMRECOVERY
more informationAdditional resources:
Your county agricultural agent, your
local veterinarian♦If feed supplies are limited, give the largest portion of available feed
to the highest producing cows and those recently fresh. This may be a
good time to cull the herd.
♦Clean and sanitize milking parlor, dairy barn and equipment before
returning to normal use.
♦Watch for signs of mastitis, which is likely to flare up if milking
methods, time and equipment have been changed.
SANITATION
♦Clean out hog houses, barns and chicken houses. Spray buildings with
a good disinfectant before animals occupy them again. Air buildings
thoroughly to dry them out.
♦Remove debris from dairy barns. Scrub and disinfect walls, ceilings,
floors, stanchions and other equipment.
♦Scrub the milk house and equipment with detergent and hot water.
Sanitize equipment, walls, ceilings and floors with dairy sanitizer
equipment.
♦Dispose of animal carcasses promptly. If there is no rendering
company operating nearby, burn or bury carcasses deeply in a place
approved by your local soil conservation office.
INSECTS
Mosquitoes and other pests may be abundant after a flood. They not only
annoy animals, but some species carry disease. Spray animals with an
insect repellent as recommended by your county agricultural agent.

TIPS ON CLEANING AND RECONDITIONING
Try to clean tractors, trucks and
farm equipment as soon as
possible. Delay will make dirt
and silt harder to remove and
may cause considerable rusting
and corrosion. If you use farm
vehicles and equipment before
proper reconditioning, you may
seriously damage them.
Have your dealer or another
expert recondition engines. They
need to be completely
disassembled for cleaning and
reconditioning. Do not try to
move or start an engine that has
been submerged until it has
been cleaned and reconditioned,
since dirt will damage bearings
and precision parts. If the tractor
was submerged only to the
platform, you will need to
service only the wheel bearings
and moving parts that were
under water.EMERGENCY CLEANING
If you must use the tractor or engine immediately, or if you think the cost
of professional reconditioning is not worthwhile, use the following
procedure. This procedure isn't thorough enough to prevent possible
damage or need for overhaul in the future.
♦Clean exterior thoroughly with a hose. Scrub greasy deposits with
solvent.
♦Remove spark plugs or fuel injectors, air cleaner, intake manifold and
carburetor. Clean these parts thoroughly with solvent.
♦Drain the crankcase. Flush the crankcase with oil and refill with clean
oil. Also disconnect fuel lines, blowing them out with compressed air.
♦Crank the engine slowly with spark plugs or fuel injectors removed to
force water out of cylinders. Squirt light lubricating oil into each
cylinder and let it stand for about five minutes. Then crank the engine
slowly to lubricate cylinder walls and rings.
♦Replace all filters — engine, fuel, hydraulic.
♦Completely flush out the fuel system — tank, pump, lines — with #1
diesel fuel. Be extremely careful to avoid fire danger.
♦Replace starter and generator. Have an expert service them.
♦Drain and flush the transmission and final drive with solvent. Refill
with new, clean oil.
WHEEL BEARINGS, COOLING SYSTEMS AND
BATTERIES
♦Remove and clean unsealed wheel and track bearings with solvent.
Lubricate and replace the bearings. Factory-sealed bearings should not
need cleaning if the seal is unbroken.
♦Flush the cooling systems with fresh water, and clean the radiator
fins.
♦Replace the battery, if necessary. If it was submerged, it will probably
need to be replaced.

Your county agricultural agentSTARTING AND INITIAL OPERATION
♦Examine the machine and turn it over by hand after you have cleaned
and replaced all parts. If it turns freely, it is probably ready for
operation. Turn on the engine and operate the machine at low speed
until you are sure all parts are working smoothly.
♦If there is a substantial amount of dirt in the crankcase, transmission
or gear train, change the oil and oil filter after operating the machine
for a few hours. Using fresh lubricant is cheaper than paying for
additional repairs.
ADDITIONAL STEPS FOR TRUCKS AND CARS
♦Remove inside door panels. Clean and lubricate latches and window
raising mechanisms.
♦Remove seats and floor mats. Brush and vacuum thoroughly. Clean
washable surfaces with soap and water. Use rug or upholstery
shampoo on non-washable areas. Dry thoroughly.
♦Disassemble leaf springs. Clean or replace spring pads if necessary.
♦Have brakes and steering mechanism checked before you drive the
vehicle.
RECONDITIONING FARM IMPLEMENTS
Follow applicable steps above, and clean rest of machine as follows:
♦Chains.Soak chains in solvent for several hours, then remove chains
and allow solvent to drain out of them. Soak chains for several hours
in light oil, then drain off excess oil and replace chains on machine.
♦Gears and sprockets. Clean exposed gears and sprockets with
cleaning solvent. Coat gears with light oil.
♦Gear cases. Inspect enclosed gear cases for water or grit. Water may
be present below the oil. If you find water or grit, or if you are in
doubt, drain the case, flush it with solvent and refill with clean oil.
♦Belts.Examine all belts for tears or cracks. Repair or replace them as
necessary.
♦Cutting parts. Remove knives and cutter bars from mowers and
combines. Clean and dry them. Coat cutter parts with light oil and
reassemble. Inspect the insides of combines and remove accumulated
dirt, chaff, debris or water.
♦Soil-working tools. Clean dirt and rust from surfaces of soil-working
tools such as mold boards, discs and cultivator shovels. Coat these
tools with rust preventive grease or used crankcase oil.

CLEAN-UP, SOIL TESTING AND COVER CROPS
If sediment came from fertile
fields of your upstream
neighbors, the fertility status of
the field will probably be
unchanged or higher than before
the flood. If heavy sedimentation
occurs, these soils should be
tested to determine nutrient
status. Take soil samples at a 6-
to 8-inch depth in at least 15
locations per field. Each soil
sample should represent 20
acres or less. Areas with
significant differences in
textures should be sampled
separately.
Sand deposits may have to be
removed or spread over other
areas and mixed with the more
productive soil beneath. Sand
deposits on top of silty or
clay-type soils deeper than 4
inches may decrease potential
crop yields. Determine the
location, depth and amount of
coverage of sand. Call your
county Extension agent for
further guidelines.

♦Open all drainage ditches.
♦Remove debris from fields and pastures. Look carefully for partially
hidden objects that could injure livestock or damage machinery.
Check hedge and fence rows carefully.
♦To prevent severe soil compacting, avoid running trucks and heavy
farm equipment over wet soils. Most soils are not dry enough for
traffic or cultivation until the top 5 or 6 inches crumble, rather than
slick over or pack.
♦Encourage the growth of cover crops such as rye or wheat. Any type
of plant growth is effective in drying waterlogged soils.
♦It is usually not necessary to remove silt deposits. After soils are dry
enough to work, level and mix silt deposits into original topsoil, if
practical.
♦Apply animal manure and incorporate into soil. Check with your
county Extension agent for recommended application rates.
♦The fertility level of flooded soils will probably change over a period
of time. Do not guess at requirements. Take soil samples to determine
new fertility levels. Follow recommendations. Allow for nutrients
supplied by applied animal manures. When sampling silted fields,
make sure the samples represent the soil mix that will exist after
deposited silt is mixed with the original topsoil.
♦Avoid deep tillage or subsoiling unless advised by an agronomist.
Deep tillage or subsoiling is rarely beneficial and could be harmful.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative Extension FLOOD-FARMRECOVERYSalvaging Crops After Flooding
RECOVERY OF ALFALFA, IRRIGATED PASTURES AND HAY
Many factors affect the extent of
crop damage after a flood.
Seasonal temperatures can be a
major factor. A July flood, for
example, is often much worse
for crop survival than a spring
flood. The warmer mid-summer
weather increases the rate of
damage and death to submerged
plants. During spring flooding,
temperatures are colder and
plants can survive longer under
water.
Plants that encounter
flash-flooding along creeks
where the water rises and
recedes quickly are most likely
to survive. They will experience
less oxygen depletion than
submerged plants. Other factors
for survival include water
movement and plant height.
Standing water is more harmful
than moving water. Plants with
some leaves protruding from the
water are more likely to live.
Restoration of alfalfa, irrigated
pastures, perennials and hay will
depend heavily on all of these
factors. But it also depends on
the steps you take toward
recovery.ALFALFA
Alfalfa can withstand submersion for a limited time, depending on its stage
of growth. Dormant plants may withstand submersion for as long as seven
to 10 days. Growing plants can usually withstand submersion for less than
three to four days without damage.
Alfalfa can recover from moderate silt deposits. Silt deposits of over 2 to 3
inches will weaken the stand, and you may need to regrade and
re-establish in places.
Limit reseeding of established fields to silted patches within the field. If
the entire field is silted, rework and reseed the field. Where alfalfa stand is
over two years old, overseed with temporary crop and reseed alfalfa at
least one month after having reworked the field.
You can reseed small areas with fast-growing grasses. This will help
provide forage until the entire field can be reworked. In old fields, seeding
to annual crops such as ryegrass will provide some hay and also will help
control weeds.
IRRIGATED PASTURES
You probably can restore irrigated pastures without serious production
losses if silt deposits are not over 2 inches and erosion is minimal.
Recovery usually depends on the type of legume. Alfalfa probably will
recover from moderate silting better than white clover varieties. White
clover will not survive silting that covers the ends of the growing stems or
stolons. Ladino clover, however, will fill in stands from a few surviving
plants if the area is not too large.
Grasses such as ryegrass, orchardgrass, fescue and meadow foxtail will
probably grow through a moderate silt deposit, and can stand several days
of flooding without injury. Tall fescue will tolerate more water than
ryegrass or orchardgrass. Meadow foxtail and reed canary grass can stand
longer submersion than other perennial grasses.
Subsurface water saturating the root zone of deep-rooted crops such as
alfalfa can damage the plant as much as surface water. To take care of
excess soil moisture, open drainage ditches as soon as possible.

more informationAdditional resources:
Your county agricultural agentOVERLY MATURE PERENNIALS
Some overly mature alfalfa or clover grass can be partially salvaged by
mixing with less mature forage and ensiling the crop. Although nutritional
value will be low, this is a fast method of removing the crop to ensure a
good second cutting.
Ensile perennials in either conventional upright or temporary trench silos.
To make a trench silo:
♦Locate the trench where drainage is good.
♦Design the trench for efficient feeding. A long, narrow, deep trench
results in less feeding loss than a wide, shallow trench.
To make the silage:
♦Direct cut or wilt to 65 to 70 percent moisture.
♦Chop fine.
♦Pack thoroughly.
♦If available, add 100 to 200 pounds of corn and cob chop per ton of
ensiled nutrients. This will improve fermentation, quality and
palatability.
HAY
To minimize damage to flooded hay crops:
♦Remove old growth from fields that have not been harvested. This
will encourage a good aftermath crop.
♦Make this crop into hay or silage.
♦If crop is silt-damaged, chop it uniformly back onto the field. Then
topdress immediately with fertilizer. You also may want to apply
nitrogen to stimulate legumes as well as grasses. Check with an
agronomist for recommended application rates.
♦On fields harvested just prior to the flood, make crop into hay or
silage. Then topdress field with fertilizer. Check with your county
agricultural agent for specific recommendations.
♦If growth is short or yellow, topdress immediately.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionWeed Management After a Flood
STRATEGIES FOR THIS YEAR AND NEXT
Floods can affect weeds both
the year they occur and in
subsequent years. The biggest
impact in the flood year will be
the reduced competitive ability
of the crop. Weeds will take
advantage of the stunted or
killed crops and grow to
maturity.
In the year after a flood, new
weed problems will be likely.
Some of the weeds carried into
the field by floodwaters may not
have germinated in time to be
noticed during the previous
growing season. Mechanical and
chemical methods need to be
considered in both the flood
year and subsequent years to
manage weeds. A bioassay
test—in which seeds are planted
in flooded and non-flooded soil
samples—can be helpful to
determine if soils are safe for
intended crops.IF THE CROP RECOVERS
If the crop recovers after the flood, make an effort to reduce the impact of
weed competition. This may not be practical if fields are too wet to enter
for mechanical or chemical weeding.
♦Check fields regularly to monitor crop and weed development. Take
note of weed species. Are there any new species? This may happen if
weed seeds were carried into the field by floodwater. Make a field
map of these weed locations and use it to plan next year's weed
management program.
♦Consider whether herbicides can be safely applied. Most labels clearly
specify the maximum growth stage of the crop at which the product
can be used. Applications following a mid-season flood are very
likely beyond this “window” of application timing. Most labels also
caution against using herbicides if the crop is under any stress. Thus,
the feasibility of herbicide use the same year as a flood occurs is
limited.
♦If herbicide use is feasible but conditions are extremely wet, consider
using a commercial sprayer equipped with flotational tires.
WHEN CROPS ARE DAMAGED
Flooding usually kills the crop or at least injures it so severely that it will
not be be worth harvesting. If this is the case, try to prevent weeds from
going to seed through the use of mowing, tillage or chemical application.
♦As mentioned above, take note of any new weed species that are
present. Make a field map of the weeds to plan next year's weed
control program.
♦Mowing will allow some weeds to survive but may hasten drying of
the soil more than using herbicides. Mowing is also an option if the
soil is too wet to be tilled.
♦Mechanically tilling the soil, if it is dry enough, will destroy weeds. It
will also aerate the soil more than either mowing or spraying.
♦Applying non-selective, non-residual herbicides may be a good option
if the soil is too wet to work mechanically.
♦Repeat either mowing, tillage or chemical application if another
generation of weeds emerges that will have time to produce seed.
University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative Extension FLOOD-FARMRECOVERY
more informationFINAL DECISIONS
Should you allow even more
time than product labels specify
before planting rotation crops?
Probably not if you have used
DNAs (as noted in chart), but it's
difficult to say for other
chemicals. Consider whether
floodwaters brought in untreated
soil from other fields. Also
consider whether runoff
removed a significant part of the
applied product. When in doubt,
use the bioassay test described
at right or send a soil sample to
a commercial lab for chemical
analysis. In some cases it may
be appropriate to allow an extra
week or two beyond the normal
plant-back interval and deep till
the field to dilute any remaining
residues.
Once the field has been planted,
monitor it carefully for possible
weed problems. If weed
densities approach the economic
threshold, use the appropriate
mechanical or chemical
measures to control them.
Additional resources:
Your county agricultural agentTHE YEAR AFTER THE FLOOD
Be alert for new weed problems the year after the flood. Some weeds may
have germinated after you made an assessment of weeds during the flood
year. Others may have remained dormant until this season. The flood may
also have deposited soil that is different in texture, pH and organic matter
content. These factors may influence herbicide performance and crop
safety. Take soil samples and base herbicide selection and rates on current
soil characteristics.
The “new soil” may have herbicide residues from the previous season's
application. These levels are unlikely to affect this year's crop, but it would
be wise to do a simple bioassay test to determine if planned crops are
feasible in the flood-deposited soil. To carry out a bioassay test:
♦Take several soil samples from the flooded field (1 quart per sample)
and plant three or four seeds of the planned crop in each one.
♦Collect soil samples from a known herbicide-free site to use as a
standard and likewise plant three or four seeds of the planned crop.
♦Grow the seedlings for two to four weeks.
♦If plants in the flooded soil are normal and appear to grow as well as
those in the herbicide-free soil, indications are strong that it is safe to
plant your crop.
♦If crop growth in the flooded soil is abnormal, have an agricultural
professional determine if the symptoms are related to possible
herbicide residues in the soil or to other causes, such as nutrient
deficiencies or diseases.
A CLOSER LOOK AT HERBICIDES
Herbicides decompose in the soil by microbial action. This breakdown is
slowed under flooded (anaerobic) conditions. Soil temperatures also are
cooler under flooded and wet soil conditions, slowing both microbial and
chemical degradation. Thus, the potential for herbicide carryover that
would injure the subsequent crop may increase after flooding. A summary
of possible effects of flooding on herbicide breakdown is given below:
Degradation Under
Product or Chemical Family Anaerobic Conditions
Triazines (atrazine, Bladex, Sencor) slower
Thicarbamates (Eradicane, Sutan+) slower
DNAs (Treflan, Prowl) faster
Acetanailides (Lasso, Dual, Frontier) can degrade anaerobically
Substituted ureas (Lorox) unknown
Roundup can degrade anaerobically
Accent and Beacon unknown
Hoelon much slower
Poast, Fusilade, Assure unknown

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensiondroughtDrought Preparedness and Response
STRATEGIES FOR FARMERS
Of all natural disasters, drought
is the most gradual and hard to
predict. Once it has affected
crop growth, farmers and
producers enter a new territory
of what if's. What if it rains next
week? What if it doesn't rain for
a month? Alternative crops may
have to be planted or crop loss
assistance applied for. If feed
supplies are low, herds may
have to be culled and/or feeds
purchased. For farmers who
were already facing financial
hardship, a drought can force
major decisions about
diversification, irrigation,
surviving a major loss or even
selling the farm.
The fact that Wisconsin suffered
record droughts as recently as
1976-77 and 1988 underscores
the fact that droughts are a
natural occurrence. Fortunately,
farmers can take some actions
to better prepare for and survive
a drought. The key is a
combination of sound farmstead
planning and sound
decision-making, based on
advice and up-to-date
information from resources like
your Cooperative Extension
Service.BE PREPARED
♦Examine your water use efficiency and irrigation needs. If you
already irrigate, contact your agricultural agent about using the
Wisconsin Irrigation Scheduling Program (WISP). This research-based
program assists growers in determining frequency and amounts of
irrigation (if any) throughout the growing season; it can be extremely
helpful during a drought. If you do not currently irrigate, consult with
your agricultural agent and irrigation system dealers now — before a
drought occurs. Emergency irrigation systems are difficult to put in
place because of the permitting process (which may take 30 days or
more) and possible lack of equipment mid-season (dealers generally
sell equipment during the winter and spring). Look carefully at
irrigation systems as a long-term investment.
♦Keep up-to-date forage inventories. Accurate forage inventories in
silos, hay mows and other storage areas help you determine feed
supplies during a drought. Note the amount and accessibility of each
lot of uniform quality forage. Your local feed representative or
agricultural agent can assist you with this process.
♦Consider alternative on-farm related businesses (AOFRB).
Diversification can be a good long-term approach to revenue shortfalls
from drought. Some potential businesses include:
a) Alternative crops such as shiitake mushrooms, ginseng, specialty
vegetables, greenhouse plants, dried and/or cut flowers, etc.
b) Alternative livestock, such as llamas, ducks, bees, deer for venison
or mink.
c) Forestry, including cord wood, maple syrup, apple orchards and
Christmas trees.
d) Non-production farm-related ventures such as camping, fee
hunting/shooting preserves, trout ponds, farm vacations, bed and
breakfast establishments, summer camps on the farm, herd sitting,
boat and camper storage, and farm markets.
e) Home-based enterprises including sewing projects, crafts, catering
services, upholstery, secretarial service/word processing,
taxidermy, etc.
Contact your Cooperative Extension office or your Small Business
Development Center for more information.

more informationAFTER A DROUGHT
♦Financial issues. Continue to
pursue government drought
assistance programs if you have
not yet received relief; your
county Extension office can help
you through the application
process. Also, see your
accountant about tax issues
related to the drought. If you
received federal disaster
payments, you may be able to
postpone reporting them on
your income taxes for a year.
Likewise, if you sold livestock
because of the drought, you may
be able to postpone reporting
gains on the sale for as long as
two years afterward.
♦Crop testing for feed.
Nutritional values of crops are
often affected by drought. Have
fresh forage tested for high
nitrate levels and nutritional
value. Have oats and barley
tested for nutritional value;
nitrates usually are not a
problem. Consult with your
livestock nutritionist about corn
quality and use. Test for
mycotoxins in grain fields.
♦Soil testing. Because of the
potential for herbicide and
fertilizer carryover, soil testing is
very important following a
drought year. See the fact sheets
“Fertilizer Application After a
Drought,” and “Herbicide
Concerns After a Drought Year,”
for test recommendations.
Additional resources:
Your county agricultural agentDURING A DROUGHT
♦Discuss financial and feed assistance in the early phase of a drought.
The earlier you enroll in feed assistance or financial assistance
programs, the sooner you will be eligible for help. See your county
agricultural agent about eligibility for grants, loans and other types of
assistance. Likewise, contact your lender about potential problems
before you are in over your head. You may be able to renegotiate
current payment plans and establish an emergency plan if the drought
persists and additional financing is needed.
♦Look to your county agricultural agent for up-to-date information on
managing during a drought. As part of a network of county, state and
national research and field experts, your agent receives new
informa-tion daily on managing during a drought. If your agent
doesn't have the answer to your question, he or she can find the
answer or refer you to the person for help.
♦Adjust fertilizer rates. If you haven't already applied fertilizers, adjust
your rates based on lower yield expectancy for the drought year. If
little or no production is expected, consider skipping an application.
♦Be prepared to use mechanical weed control. Many herbicides lose
effectiveness during dry periods, making mechanical weed control
your second line of defense against weeds.
♦Protect livestock from heat. Adequate water, shade and ventilation in
buildings are critical during hot, humid weather . Consider letting
livestock out of buildings to cool them at night. Call a veterinarian if
heat stress is a concern.
♦Consider alternative crops. If your fields have less than 12 alfalfa
plants per square foot or a 75 percent reduction in corn stand
population, consider alternative forages. Some possibilities include
sudangrass, sorghum-sudan hybrids, milage and millet. Corn silage
might be the best forage alternative; even the worst fields have silage
potential. Discuss possible options with your agricultural agent.
♦Cull unprofitable cattle. If forage is inadequate, selling unprofitable
livestock may be your next best move. Consider culling the bottom 5
to 15 percent. Review your options and the economics of the situation
with Extension agents.
♦Recognize the early warning signs of emotional stress. Stress can
overwhelm farmers and their families. Some of the warning signs of
severe stress include anxiety, depression, anger, violence and
withdrawal. If you see these signs in yourself, a family member or
friend, get outside assistance. Professional counselors, a clergy
member or social worker can help, as well as the Farmers Assistance
Hotline for Wisconsin at (800) 942-2474.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionProtecting Livestock From Heat
STRATEGIES FOR FARMERS WHEN TEMPERATURES CLIMB
When temperatures and humidity
begin to rise in Wisconsin, keep
a close eye on livestock.
Temperatures in the high 80s
and the 90s can cause problems,
as well as a 75 degree F. day
coupled with high humidity. Heat
stress can cause general
discomfort, decline in animal
performance and animal death.PROVIDE SHADE AND NIGHT-TIME COOLING
♦If animals are kept outside, provide shade during hot weather. Heat
from the sun is a major culprit in overstressed animals.
♦Swine may sunburn during hot, sunny weather. Try to keep them out
of the sun. Sun shades can cut the radiant heat load by as much as 40
percent; ask your county Extension agent for information on their
construction. Pasture wallows are also effective for sunburn protection
and wet skin cooling.
♦Turn cows outside at night to cool them and cool the barn. Since
animals cool themselves primarily through breathing, barns tend to get
warm and humid quickly.
PROVIDE ADEQUATE WATER
Ample drinking water is vital to animals during hot and humid conditions.
Animals cool themselves by panting (water loss from the lungs) and
through water evaporation from the skin. Increased respiration during hot
weather is especially important for pigs and other animals that do not
sweat. Animals must replace the water loss to cool themselves.
♦Maintain access to water. Provide automatic drinking cups so animals
can meet their requirements during hot weather.
♦Keep water containers clean.
♦Adjust the drinking space for the size and number of animals in the
pen or group. Excessive volumes of water grow warm and stale
throughout the day. (See the fact sheet “Livestock Water and
Nutrition.”)
♦Check the water delivery systems periodically for plugs or other
problems.
♦If necessary, spray water on animals to cool them.
PROVIDE GOOD VENTILATION
Proper ventilation helps maintain livestock health during hot and humid
weather. Without adequate air exchanges and airflow distribution within
livestock buildings, heat and moisture accumulate and animal production is
affected. Contact a ventilation specialist to inspect and update your system,
if necessary. Your county Extension office also may be able to help you.

♦Use the temperature humidity index as a guide to heat stress. Listen
to local or regional weather reports for the temperature humidity
index (THI) for your area. Some levels of concern include:
a) Above 75 THI - Heat stress on high-producing cows begins to
decrease feed intake and lower milk production.
b) Above 80 THI - Severe heat stress may occur for cows on
pasture. Shade and adequate ventilation are essential to minimize
milk loss.
c) Above 83-85 THI - Danger of fatal heat stress occurs.
♦Keep an eye on animals. If heat stress is a concern, check animal
temperature. Dairy cow temperatures approaching 104 to 106 degrees
F. are dangerous. At 107 degrees F., spontaneous heart failure is
possible. Call a veterinarian and use methods listed above to keep
animals cool.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionManaging Livestock During a Drought
WHEN WATER AND FEED SUPPLIES BECOME A CONCERN
Drought usually gets its
reputation from its impact on
crops. But its impact on
livestock can be equally
dramatic. Hot, dry weather
increases the water needs of
livestock but often decreases
water supplies. Crops may not
yield as planned, causing a feed
shortage. Consequently, farmers
may face special challenges,
including decisions about
whether to buy feed or sell
livestock.WATER REQUIREMENTS
Water requirements may increase to double the normal intake for animals
during hot weather. Clean, fresh water is important. If animals do not meet
their water needs, they may refuse to eat, experience lowered production,
become sick or die.
Water supplies also may become a problem as the drought wears on. Wells
and piping may be inadequate if water demand increases dramatically;
shallow wells and streams may dry up. You may need to transport water.
Contact your local emergency government office or your county Extension
office for information on water supply assistance.
Some general water estimates for various conditions and animals:
♦Daily water intake for beef cattle at 88 degrees F.:
a) Cows -16.5 gallons for nursing calves; 14 gallons for bred dry
cows and heifers.
b) Bulls - 18 gallons.
c) Growing cattle - 9 gallons for 400 lb. animal; 12 for 600 lb.; 14
for 800 lb.
d) Finishing cattle - 14 for 600 lb. animal; 17 for 800 lb.; 20 for
1,000 lb.; 22.5 for 1,200 lb.
♦Daily water intake for dairy cattle at 80 degrees F.:
a) Dry cows (for maintenance and pregnancy) - 16.2 gallons for
1,400 lb. animal; 17.3 for 1,700 lb.
b) Lactating, 1,400-lb. cows (for maintenance and milk production) -
17.9 gallons for 20 lb. milk production; 24.7 for 60 lb. milk
production; 38.7 for 80 lb. milk production; 45.7 for 100 lb. milk
production.
c) Heifers - 3.3 gallons for 200 lb. animal; 6.1 for 400 lb.; 10.6 for
800 lb.; 14.5 for 1,200 lb. (for maintenance and pregnancy).
♦Average daily water intake for swine:
a) Breeding herd - 2 to 3 gallons for gestating sows and boars; 4 to
5 gallons for lactating sows.
b) Young pigs - One-half to 1 gallon for weaned pigs (15-50 lb.); 1
gallon for growing pigs (50-120 lb.); 1.5-2 gallons for finishing
pigs (120 lb. to market).
Increase amounts for hot, dry conditions.

a) Buy or obtain additional feed. Feed assistance may be available
from relief groups, the ASCS or through loans. Volunteer
organizations typically offer hay lifts during drought years.
Contact your county Extension office for more information.
b) Sell non-essential animals. The money received can help buy
additional feed for remaining animals.
♦Plant alternative crops for forage. A number of crops, including
70-day corn, buckwheat and millet, may be planted mid-summer to
offset early losses. (See the fact sheet “Alternative Crops During a
Drought.”)
♦Talk about it. Drought can bring feelings of great anger, frustration
and hopelessness to farmers, especially for those already experiencing
tough financial times. It's critical that producers talk about the stress
they are feeling, rather than isolating themselves from family or
neighbors. In some cases, intervention may be needed to connect
farmers with counselors, clergy members or other professionals. (See
the fact sheet “Identifying Stress in Family and Others.”)

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionTillage During a Drought
WHAT TO DO — AND NOT TO DO — WHEN SOILS ARE DRY
The best advice on tillage during
a drought may be: avoid it.
When soils are dry, you should
do everything you can to
conserve remaining moisture.
This may mean holding off on
plowing, disking and cultivating
so as not to disturb soils and let
moisture escape in the process.
Keep in mind that any operation
that brings soil up to the surface
may worsen conditions.
The guidelines at right offer
some general considerations.
For advice specific to your crops
and drought conditions, contact

“Managing Drought-Stressed Corn and
Soybeans,” (NCR238).GENERAL GUIDELINES
♦Minimum tillage. Try to use minimum tillage techniques if possible.
These will leave crop residue from the preceding year on the surface,
thereby reducing evaporation of moisture from the soil. Conservation
tillage may be a particularly good method because it leaves more than
30 percent of the residues, such as old cornstalks, in fields after
planting.
♦Weed control. Use chemical weed control, rather than tillage, to
manage weeds. With chemical weed control, you avoid disturbing the
soil and causing moisture loss.
♦Planting. While it helps to plant in the moist soil below the dry
surface, don't plant beyond the maximum recommended depth for
your crop.
♦Tilling.If you must till, keep it at a shallow level. For example, when
field cultivating, use a depth of 2 to 3 inches, rather than 4 to 5. Do
not subsoil.
♦Chisel plowing. If using a chisel plow, use sweeps instead of twisted
shovels on it. The sweeps bring up less soil, while leaving more crop
residue on the soil surface. As a result, less moisture is lost from the
soil.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative Extension DROUGHT-FARMDROUGHTIrrigation During a Drought
CONSIDERATIONS FOR NON-IRRIGATING FARMERS
Drought conditions are great
anxiety producers, especially if
you don't normally irrigate your
crops. As painful as it may be,
however, the best advice for
non-irrigators is often to wait
things out during a drought.
While some irrigation equipment
may be available on an
emergency basis from dealers or
area irrigators, the permitting
process for surface water or
groundwater sources can take
well over a month. Furthermore,
the manpower, training, and
financing needed to develop an
irrigation system make it
unrealistic as a short-term
solution. Running an irrigation
system can be a full-time job in
itself, one that can take three
years to master, and one that
may take ten years to pay off
through increased production.
One thing you can do is
realistically evaluate whether an
irrigation system makes sense
for you in the the long run.
Follow the guidelines at right to
make this determination and to
understand the processes
involved in setting up an
irrigation system.DO SOME RESEARCH
Consider irrigation in relation to your type of crops, soil, water availability,
time and farm budget. Irrigation systems have become increasingly
sophisticated—something that makes them more valuable in terms of
productivity, but also more of a commitment in terms of time, management
and financial investment. Discuss the matter with your county Extension
office, other irrigators and equipment dealers.
♦Collect information on your soils and local climatic conditions. If you
have a sandy soil with lower water-holding capacity, for instance, an
irrigation system can make a significant difference in crop yields. You
can get a county soils report from the local USDA Soil Conservation
Service office, county Extension office or Land Conservation
department.
♦Examine the types of crops you currently grow for root depth and
therefore, water needs. You want to be sure that irrigation equipment
costs will be offset by an increase in yields or quality of crop. You
should also consider the possibility of growing higher value crops
(using irrigation) such as potatoes, strawberries, sweet corn, dry
beans, snap beans, cucumbers, potatoes and carrots. Are they realistic
for your soil type and climatic conditions?
♦Consider water sources. Contact the Wisconsin Geological and
Natural History Survey for information about groundwater sources for
your area. See the section below for guidelines regarding surface
water.
♦Talk to irrigation equipment dealers about irrigation systems and
what might be appropriate for your current or future needs.
Topography and field size are two of many factors affecting system
needs.
♦Consider the economics of irrigation. Discuss potential yields with
other area irrigators as well as your Extension agent. In general,
irrigation may more than double yields in a field, and pay for itself
within 10 years. Increases may be 75-80 bushels of corn per acre and
four tons more alfalfa per acre. However, success with irrigation
varies depending upon soils, weather, climate, type of irrigation, etc.
♦Assess your current economic conditions. Talk to your lenders.
Irrigation may not be a good idea right now because of the financial
burden. However, it may be something to plan for in the future.

Management in Wisconsin—the
Wisconsin Irrigation Scheduling
Program,” (WISP), (A3600).SURFACE WATER AS AN IRRIGATION SOURCE
Surface water diversions generally cover rivers, lakes and streams.
Riparian land—land which adjoins these waterways—is the first
requirement for irrigators. In order to obtain a surface water diversion
permit from the DNR, you also will need:
♦A legal description of the land to be irrigated, such as NE1/4 of
SE1/4 of Sec. 23, T14N, R10E.
♦A waiver from downstream irrigators, hydropower dams, municipal or
industrial waste dischargers.
♦A “chain of title” test (an abstract examined by an attorney), which
determines the acreage of riparian land.
♦The proposed diversion, including the maximum pumping rate of the
diversion, the maximum acreage to be irrigated (tillable acres), the
type of crop, inches of water per irrigation, maximum number of
irrigations anticipated per growing season, start and end dates of
irrigation per growing season.
GROUNDWATER AS AN IRRIGATION SOURCE
Groundwater diversions are covered by DNR high-capacity well permits.
These wells pump 70 gallons per minute (gpm) or more. Contact a local
well driller of the DNR District water manager to initiate the permitting
process.
For a well permit, you will need:
♦General information on water needs, property ownerships, location
and operator.
♦Design information, including a well driller's report and pump
information.
♦A DNR site inspection for local contamination.
IRRIGATION EQUIPMENT
Irrigation equipment dealers can be very helpful in assessing your needs
and potential for irrigation. Equipment ranges from large-volume traveling
sprinklers which can cover 100 acres in a week to center pivots which
water up to 133 acres in two days. The supply of equipment is somewhat
limited during the growing season. Most equipment is sold and delivered
during the winter and early spring. Keep this in mind as you begin
irrigation system planning.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionFertilizer Application After a Drought
CONSIDERATIONS FOR THIS YEAR AND NEXT
Generally, fertilizer application is
not much of an issue during a
drought year. Fertilizers often
have been applied before the
true extent of a drought is
known. If they haven't already
been applied, you need to adjust
rates based on lowered yield
expectancy for the drought year.
If little or no production is likely,
it may be best to skip an
application.
Fertilizer use does become a
significant issue the year after a
drought, however. Low crop
yields during the drought year
mean that significant amounts of
unused nutrients could remain
in the soil at the end of the
growing season. Where nutrient
carryover is substantial, fertilizer
needs for the following year are
likely to be affected. Several
methods are available to help
growers determine nitrogen,
phosphorous and potassium
carryover and current needs.PHOSPHOROUS AND POTASSIUM CARRYOVER
If phosphorous or potassium was applied but not used because of lower
than expected yields, it usually remains in the top few inches of soil. It
will not be lost over the winter. Therefore, the unused portion can be
credited against nutrient needs for next year's crops.
♦A formula for determining carryover. One method for estimating
unused phosphorous and potassium is based on the ratio of the actual
drought-year yield and the yield goal used to determine nutrient
applications that year. For example:
Drought year application = 75 lb./acre phosphate
= 300 lb./acre potash
Drought year yield goal = 6 tons/acre (alfalfa)
Actual yield = 2 tons/acre
Actual yield/yield goal = 2/6 = 1/3
Therefore, 2/3 of drought-year application is unused
Estimated carryover = 2/3 x 75 lb./acre = 50 lb./acre phosphate
= 2/3 x 300 lb./acre = 200 lb./acre potash
Comparison of the actual yield with the expected yield shows that the
drought-year yields were 1/3 of the goal. Under the assumption that
nutrient removal is proportional to yield, approximately 2/3 of the
phosphate and potash applied in the drought year was not used and likely
will be available to the next crop.
♦Soil tests. Routine soil tests also can be used to determine the current
levels of available phosphate and potash, and to obtain fertilizer
recommendations. They are useful for detecting carryover where
relatively large amounts of nutrients were applied in the drought year,
such as in topdress maintenance fertilizer programs for alfalfa.
Relatively small amounts of carryover, such as those that could occur
following application in a maintenance program for corn, might not
be detected. The tests may be done in spring or fall.
NITROGEN CARRYOVER
Following a drought year, most nitrogen carryover exists as nitrate in the
plant root zone. However, the possibility of overwinter loss of residual
nitrate makes estimation of carryover more difficult than for phosphorous

the growing season must be considered, as well as factors affecting
overwinter loss. Specifically, nitrogen carryover is likely where:
♦The drought-year crop was corn or a non-legume.
♦The crop received moderate to high amounts of nitrogen as fertilizer
or as legume or manure nitrogen credits.
♦Yields were below expected levels.
♦Soils are silt loam or heavier-textured.
♦Overwinter precipitation amounts are normal or below normal.
TESTING FOR NITROGEN CARRYOVER
A preplant soil nitrate test should be used to determine how much nitrate
has remained in the soil until the next growing season.
♦Sample in the spring. Soil samples should be collected in the spring
after the frost has left your fields and before preplant applications of
nitrogen fertilizer.
♦Collection methods.
a) Take at least 15 random soil cores from uniform soil areas no
larger than 20 acres.
b) Take separate samples from areas with soil or management
practice differences.
c) Sample in 1-foot increments to a depth of 2 feet.
d) Each sample should be placed in a clean container marked for the
appropriate depth.
e) Thoroughly mix the soil from each depth and collect a 1-cup
subsample. This sample should be sent to a soil testing lab for
analysis.
♦Air dry or freeze samples. Do not store or send composite samples to
the lab in moist condition. If samples can't be taken to the soil testing
lab within one day after collection, they should be air-dried (by
spreading on clean paper for 24 to 48 hours) as soon as possible.
Another option is to freeze your samples immediately after collection
and then either transport them to the testing lab while still frozen or
air-dry the samples before shipment.
♦Provide background information. The soil testing lab needs to know if
you applied manure to your sampled fields or if the previous crop
was a legume.
♦Provide the soil name. The name of the predominant soil and its
organic matter content within the sampled area is needed.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionWeed Management During a Drought
HERBICIDE EFFECTIVENESS AND MECHANICAL MEASURES
Dry weather after planting
causes many concerns,
including the impact of weeds
on annual crops. Many
herbicides lose effectiveness
during dry periods; growers who
use herbicides on corn and
soybean crops are likely to be
affected. Fortunately, an
awareness of herbicide
effectiveness and the aggressive
use of mechanical weed control
measures can make a difference.SOIL-APPLIED HERBICIDES
♦Preplant incorporated herbicides. These are applied before planting
and mixed into the soil. They work best when:
a) the product is mixed uniformly with soil to the depth
recommended by the manufacturer;
b) soils have reasonable moisture levels after incorporation has been
completed.
If the soil is only slightly dry, incorporated herbicides generally perform
adequately. Seldom is it so dry early in the season that incorporated
treatments fail. In a true drought, however, they may not give acceptable
weed control. Therefore, be prepared to cultivate if weeds appear.
♦Pre-emergence herbicides. These depend totally upon rainfall after
applications to “activate” the product. Rainfall positions the chemical
in the upper soil surface where the weed seeds germinate; there is no
chemical change as perhaps the term “activate” suggests. To obtain
adequate herbicide activity, however, rain must fall within 10 to 14
days after the seedbed was prepared. Without such precipitation,
pre-emergence herbicides generally fail to give acceptable weed
control even if a true drought does not develop. Therefore,
mechanical weed control may become critical within weeks of
planting. Two examples:
a) If a field is prepared to plant on April 30, corn is planted on May
1 and a pre-emergence herbicide is applied on May 2, rainfall of
at least one-quarter to one-half inches is needed within 10 to 14
days to assure adequate performance. If rainfall does not occur by
May 12, the grower should begin rotary hoeing.
b) If a field is prepared on April 30 and corn is planted on May 10,
followed by pre-emergence herbicide on May 11, plan to rotary
hoe on May 12 unless rainfall is very likely in the immediate
future.
As illustrated above, when planting and spraying are close to the field
preparation time (example a), there is more time to get the needed rainfall
to make a surface-applied herbicide perform adequately. As time between
field preparation and spraying increases (example b), there are fewer days
after an application to get a timely rain. Thus, rotary hoeing becomes
necessary sooner.
University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative Extension DROUGHT-FARMDROUGHT
more informationAdditional resources:
Your county agricultural agent
Related publications:
UW-Extension publication “Reduced
Herbicide Rates: Aspects to Consider,”
(A3563).ROTARY HOEING
Rotary hoeing kills weeds that have germinated but have not yet emerged.
These weeds are in the “white root” stage of development. After weeds
emerge, rotary hoeing is less effective. Rotary hoeing also helps place the
herbicide in the upper soil surface so that when rains do fall, the herbicide
is in a better position to be quickly taken up by weed seedlings and
hopefully kill them. If it has not rained within seven days of the first
rotary hoeing, make a second pass with the rotary hoe to kill the next
generation of weeds.
POST-EMERGENCE HERBICIDES
Post-emergence herbicides also may fail in dry weather. These treatments
work best when weeds are actively growing. When weeds are stressed by
lack of adequate soil moisture, chemical control declines. If you decide to
apply post-emergence herbicides under very dry conditions, be aware that
crop injury may occur and weed control will be poor.
CULTIVATION
In all situations, be prepared to cultivate once or twice following rotary
hoeing. Some growers mistakenly believe that soil loses more moisture
when cultivated. But remember that weeds transpire water into the
atmosphere every day they are in the field; the longer weeds live, the more
soil moisture is lost and unavailable for the crop, and the harder they are
to eradicate. So it is always a wise decision to cultivate weeds early on.
♦Cultivate when the weeds are relatively small and the crop is large
enough (at least 4 inches tall) to allow you to roll some soil into the
row without covering the crop.
♦The crop should be at least three times as tall as the weeds when the
first cultivation is done (for example, the crop is 6 inches tall and the
weeds are 2 inches or less tall). This way, the weeds in the row can
be covered with minimal effect on the crop.
♦The cultivator need not be set any deeper than a couple of inches to
dislodge the weeds; little if any moist soil will be brought to the
surface.
♦A second cultivation can be done when the crop is 14 to 18 inches
tall. This requires timely mechanical practices, but keep in mind that
in drought years, a few uncontrolled weeds cost more in reduced yield
than in years with ample moisture.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionAlternative Crops During a Drought
MEETING FORAGE AND GRAIN NEEDS IN AN EMERGENCY
Alternative crops can be a major
concern during a drought. If
planting was postponed or
plants didn't survive because of
drought, mid-summer planting
may be necessary for adequate
forage or grain. You also may be
concerned about feed supplies
for next year and, therefore, wish
to plant additional crops this fall.
Unfortunately, no one can
predict the longevity of a
drought. But you do have
options, and the knowledge that
planning ahead is always a good
idea.ALTERNATIVE FORAGES FOR THIS YEAR
Before giving up on existing crops, examine your current crops for silage
potential. Corn, for example, may be the best forage alternative available.
Also, keep in mind the added labor and cost of establishing alternative
crops. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee regarding yield or quality of
alternative forages.
♦Existing crops as alternative forages. Test these forages and use the
data to obtain efficient use through balanced rations:
a) alfalfa, red clover, trefoil
b) corn and soybeans
c) peas or canning crops
d) small grains
e) grasses
♦Summer-seeded crops. These generally should be seeded by July 15
and only if moisture is available for germination and emergence.
Crops include:
a) sudan, sorghum-sudan and forage sorghum
b) hybrid pearl millet
c) soybeans (alone or mixed with sorghum-sudan)
d) 70-day corn
e) brassicas - forage rape, turnips
f) millets - common, German, foxtail or Japanese
g) buckwheat
h) winter grain with field peas. These should be planted from mid- to
late-August.
♦Alternative cash crops. If you planted cash crops such as wheat or
corn, but drought is causing problems, you may decide to replant.
Some good alternatives are buckwheat and millet, which can be
planted in July. These are very short season crops and both are high
in fiber. Consider whether you have a market to sell these two crops
or whether you can feed them to livestock.
MEETING DEMANDS FOR NEXT YEAR
♦Spring grains. If moisture is available for germination and emergence,
you can plant spring grains like wheat, oats or barley in August.
These can be harvested until a hard freeze, which usually occurs in
late October.
University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative Extension DROUGHT-FARMDROUGHT
more informationAdditional resources:
Your county agricultural agent♦Winter rye and winter wheat. For the earliest harvest of forage next
spring, plant winter rye in September. It can be harvested mid-May.
Another alternative is winter wheat, which has a higher forage yield
but must be harvested seven to ten days later.
REDUCING THE RISK OF DROUGHT STRESS
The only sure method to avoid drought-stressed crops is to use irrigation.
Other management practices, however, can help reduce the risk of drought
stress.
♦Early planting. By planting early, you increase the chance of having
pollination completed before the driest part of the season.
♦Optimum fertilization. Proper fertilization will promote healthy plant
growth and efficient moisture utilization, essential for high yields in
both normal and dry years.
♦Adequate weed control. Weeds compete with crop plants for water, so
controlling weeds will provide more water for the crop.
♦Residue management. By maintaining a cover of residue through
conservation tillage or no-till, you can reduce the amount of
evaporation from the soil surface and conserve water for the crop's
use.

ANALYZING NUTRITIONAL VALUE AND SAFETY
Drought-stressed crops may
often be salvaged, but testing
for nutritional value and harmful
substances is extremely
important. Nitrate toxicity and
aflatoxins may be a problem in
drought years. Depending on
test results, feed amounts need
to be adjusted for animal
nutrition and safety.

Poisoning,” (A1889);

If plants show signs of drought stress, be careful about using them as fresh
forage because nitrate levels may be high. A better option is to use plants
as silage, because the silage fermentation process reduces nitrate levels. In
either case, testing is critical for safe feeding.
Symptoms of nitrate poisoning in livestock include labored breathing,
frothing at the mouth and a brownish color of the nonpigmented skin
within a few hours after feeding. Abortions can occur; death may occur
within an hour in extreme cases.
♦Silage should be stored at least three weeks before testing and feeding
take place.
♦Testing is available from private companies and state universities.
Contact your county Extension agent for a list of laboratories.
♦Have both a nutritional analysis and nitrate test completed on crops.
Results will take longer for nitrate tests.
♦Test results will help you determine safe feeding amounts, as well as
the need for grain and protein supplements.
OATS, BARLEY AND CORN
♦Test drought-stressed oats and barley for nutritional value. They
often are reduced to empty hulls or a very light grain. The result is
low energy and protein and a limited feeding value for poultry and
swine. Oats and barley may work well in combination with beef and
other livestock feeds.
♦Consult with your livestock nutritionist or agricultural agent about
corn use. Corn quality usually is not a concern during drought; corn
kernels may be smaller, but feeding value is not affected to the same
degree as for oats and barley. Ear corn, however, may be lower in
nutritional value due to a higher cob to kernel ratio.
♦Test for aflatoxins in grain fields. The fungus, Asperilla flavus, and
certain other molds may produce toxic substances in the field and in
storage. They historically have been a problem in southern states
where severe drought and high temperatures more commonly are
experienced. Contact your county agricultural agent for a list of
qualified laboratories.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative Extension DROUGHT-FARMDROUGHTHerbicide Concerns After a Drought
ACCOUNTING FOR CARRYOVER IN NEXT YEAR'S CROPS
When soils are moist during the
growing season, herbicides
break down through microbial
and chemical processes. These
reactions may be slowed greatly
in drought conditions. If
herbicide residues are
significant, they may injure
rotational crops in the following
season. For this reason, growers
need to be aware of herbicide
residues and take steps to
decrease risk of injury.HERBICIDE CARRYOVER LEVELS
Herbicides vary greatly in soil persistence and carryover to next year's
crops.
♦Essentially no risk. Herbicides presenting essentially no risk of
carryover for next year's crops include: 2, 4-D, Roundup, Gramoxone,
Basagran, Poast, Assure, Fusilade, Sutan, Select, Banvel, Clarity,
Blazer, Eptam, Eradicane, Lorox, Buctril, Reflex, Cobra, Butyrac, and
MCPA.
♦Moderate risk. Herbicides presenting a moderate risk of carryover to
next year's crops include: Sencor, Lexone, Bladex, Treflan, Prowl,
Accent, Beacon, Broadstrike, Velpar, Balan, Stinger, Classic,
Pinnacle, Lasso, Dual, Frontier, Surpass and Harness.
♦High risk. Herbicides presenting a high risk of carryover to next
year's crops include: atrazine, Pursuit, Scepter, Command and Princep.
AVOIDING RESIDUE PROBLEMS
♦Check the label of herbicides used during the drought season. It will
tell you the normal interval between application and planting for a
specific rotational crop. Footnotes frequently show if the risk of
carryover is greater under certain conditions (such as soil pH or dry
soils).
♦Select this year's herbicides carefully. Do not choose herbicides or
use rates that have significant injury potential by themselves. Do not
use products that may interact with carryover levels of last year's
products. For example, do not use metribuzin (Sencor, Lexone) in
soybeans this year if atrazine was used in corn planted during the
drought year.
♦Use tillage. Tillage will dilute the herbicide, especially if it is
concentrated near the surface or in bands over the row.
♦Look for herbicide tolerance. Select crop varieties or hybrids with
greater tolerance to the herbicide used during the drought year. This
information is not available for all varieties. Ask your seed supplier
for assistance.
♦Use good management practices. Good seedbeds, proper seeding
depth and rate, adequate soil fertility, and insect and disease
protection will minimize the effect of herbicide carryover. Many crops
can tolerate a single stress relatively well, but two or more stresses
can result in significant loss of crop vigor and yield.

Consider,” (A3563);
“Row Crop Cultivators,” (A3483).TESTING FOR CARRYOVER
If you choose to test for herbicide carryover, the best time to do so is
between late October and mid-November for most of Wisconsin. By this
time, soil temperatures reach and remain below 50 degrees F., a point at
which herbicide breakdown is minimal. Do not take soil samples for
residues before this time; they may indicate levels greater than actually
present when you plant next year.
♦A bioassay test may be helpful if doubts remain about planting
because of possible herbicide residues. The test will alert you to
residue problems by comparing the productivity of your intended crop
variety in both affected and unaffected soils. (Follow the guidelines in
the UW-Extension publication “A Simple Test for Atrazine
Residues.”) Begin the test at least three weeks prior to planting so
that sufficient plant growth is available to assess carryover potential.
The herbicide label may also contain suggestions on running a
bioassay test, as well as information on crop rotations and carryover
potential.
♦A chemical test for herbicide residues can also be done by private
laboratories. These tests are expensive and the results may not be
easy to interpret. However, they may be appropriate in cases where
bioassays cannot be done or where high value crops are concerned.

that come tax time, you have
some options that might make
things easier. If you have
received federal disaster
payments, you may be able to
postpone reporting them on
your income taxes for a year.
Likewise, if you were forced to
sell livestock because of the
drought, you may be able to
postpone reporting gains on the
sale for as long as two years
afterward.
Here are some basic things you
need to know. But for the best
advice for your situation, see a
tax practitioner knowledgeable
about farm tax laws and
assistance programs.CROP INSURANCE PROCEEDS AND DISASTER
PAYMENTS
If you are a cash method farmer, you are allowed to postpone reporting
insurance and disaster payments on crop losses by one year under Section
451(d) of the tax code. Generally, this rule applies when crops cannot be
planted or are damaged or destroyed by a natural disaster such as a
drought or a flood. It applies to all insurance proceeds and to federal
payments received for losses due to a natural disaster.
♦Qualifying for the election. You must be able to show that under your
normal business practice, the income from the crop would have been
reported in the year following receipt of payment for it.
♦Two options for reporting on tax returns. If you qualify for the
exception, you have the option of reporting the payments as income
in the year it is received or as income in the following year. Electing
to postpone reporting the payment as income covers all crops from a
farm. You must file a separate election for each farming business you
operate. Separate businesses are defined as those for which you keep
separate books and are allowed to use different methods of
accounting.
HOW TO MAKE THE ELECTION
The election must be attached to the return (or amended return) for the tax
year in which the payment was received. The statement must include:
♦Your name and address.
♦A declaration that you are making an election under Section 451(d).
♦Identification of the specific crop or crops destroyed or damaged.
♦A declaration that under your normal business practice, the income
from the damaged crops would have been included in your gross
income for the tax year following the damage.
♦The cause of damage of crops and the dates on which the damage
occurred.
♦The total amount of payments received from insurance carriers,
itemized with respect to each specific crop and with respect to the
date each payment was received.
♦The names of insurance carriers from whom payments were received.

more informationTHE LIVESTOCK ELECTION
The election to either roll over
the gain or defer it to next year
is fairly simple. It is made by not
reporting the deferred gain on
the tax return and by attaching a
statement showing all the details
of the involuntary conversion
including:
♦Evidence of existence of the
drought conditions that forced
the sale or exchange of the
livestock.
♦A computation of the amount
of gain realized on the sale or
exchange.
♦The number and kind of
livestock sold or exchanged.
♦The number of livestock of
each kind that would have been
sold or exchanged under the
usual business practice in the
absence of the drought.

Small Business;”

Disasters, Casualties and Thefts.”LIVESTOCK SALES
There are two tax provisions that apply to the sale of livestock because of
drought. One allows the taxpayer to roll the gain into the basis of
replacement livestock. The other allows the taxpayer to defer reporting the
income by one year.
ROLLING GAIN INTO REPLACEMENT
LIVESTOCK
If livestock are sold because of drought conditions, the gain realized on the
sale does not have to be reported if the proceeds are used to purchase
replacement livestock within two years of the end of the tax year of the
sale. This applies to livestock (other than poultry) held for any length of
time for draft, breeding or dairy (no sporting) purposes.
The new livestock must be used for the same purpose as the livestock that
were sold. Therefore, dairy cows must be replaced with dairy cows. The
taxpayer must show that the drought caused the sale of more livestock than
would have been sold without the drought conditions. The farmer has a
basis in the replacement livestock equal to the basis in the livestock sold,
plus an amount invested in the replacement livestock that exceeds the
proceeds from the sale. In this case, there is no requirement that the
drought conditions cause an area to be declared a disaster area by the
federal government.
DEFERRING INCOME TO NEXT YEAR
If any livestock are sold because of drought conditions, you may be
eligible for another exception to the general rule that the sale proceeds
must be reported in the year they are received. This election applies to all
livestock. This exception allows the taxpayer to postpone reporting the
income by one year.
To qualify, the taxpayer must show that the livestock would normally have
been sold in a subsequent year. Additionally, the sale of the livestock must
have been prompted by a drought that caused an area to be declared a
federal disaster area. It is not necessary that the livestock be raised or sold
in the declared disaster area. The sale can take place before or after an
area is declared a disaster area as long as the same disaster caused the sale.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensiontornadoesTornado Preparedness and Response
STRATEGIES FOR FAMILIES
Tornadoes are common in
Wisconsin and worth taking
seriously. The most violent
tornadoes are capable of
tremendous destruction with
wind speeds of 250 miles per
hour or more. Damage paths can
be in excess of a mile wide and
50 miles long. When a tornado is
coming, you have only a short
amount of time to make
life-or-death decisions. Advance
planning and quick response are
the keys to surviving a tornado.
A tornado is defined as a
violently rotating column of air
extending from a thunderstorm
to the ground. It usually forms
when weather is warm, humid
and unsettled, and often in
conjunction with severe
thunderstorms. Direction of
movement usually is from the
southwest to the northeast, but
a tornado's path may be erratic.
Likewise, tornadoes tend to
occur between 3 and 8 p.m., but
they may occur any time.BE PREPARED
♦Conduct tornado drills each tornado season. Designate an area in
your home as a shelter and practice having everyone in the family go
there in response to a tornado threat. A basement, storm cellar or
lowest level of your home is best. If there is no basement, use an
inner hallway or a small inner room without a window, such as a
bathroom or a closet.
♦If you live in a mobile home, plan to take shelter in another building
with a strong foundation. Some mobile home parks provide shelter for
residents. If your park does not have a community shelter, consult
with the management and request that one be provided.
♦Know the difference between a “tornado watch” and a “tornado
warning.”
a) A tornado watch is issued by the National Weather Service when
weather conditions are such that tornadoes are likely to develop.
When a watch is announced, you should listen to the radio or
television for further developments; keep a battery-powered radio
on hand in case electrical power is lost; and tie down loose
objects outside or bring them inside.
b) A tornado warning is issued when a tornado has been sighted or
indicated by radar. At this point, the danger is very serious and
everyone should go to a safe place, turn on a battery-operated
radio or television and wait for the “all clear” by the authorities.
♦Have emergency supplies on hand.
a) Flashlights and extra batteries
b) Portable battery-operated radio and extra batteries
c) First-aid kit and manual; essential medicines
d) Emergency food, water, cooking equipment, can opener
e) Cash and credit cards
f) Sturdy shoes
♦Develop an emergency communication plan. In case family members
are separated during a disaster because of work or school, choose a
long-distance relative or friend to serve as the “family contact.” After
a disaster, it is often easier to call long-distance than to make a local
call. Make sure everyone in the family knows the name, address and
phone number of the contact person.
University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative Extension TORNADOES -PREPARATION

♦Gas leaks. If you smell
the putrid odor of leaking
gas, leave your home
immediately and call the
gas company. Lanterns,
torches, electrical sparks
and cigarettes could cause
an explosive fire if there
is a leak. Do not turn on
any light switches.
♦Electrocution. Check
utility lines and
appliances for damage. If
electrical wiring appears
damaged, turn off the
current at the main fuse
box or circuit breaker.
♦Structural damage. Watch
for falling debris and the
possibility of collapse.
♦Water. If water pipes
are damaged, do not use
water from the tap; it may
be contaminated. Damaged
sewage systems should be
serviced as soon as
possible — they are health
hazards.

If you are at home during a tornado:
♦Go at once to the basement, storm cellar or the lowest level of the
building. If there is no basement, go to an inner hallway or a small
inner room without a window, such as a bathroom or a closet.
♦Get away from windows.
♦Go to the center of the room. Stay away from corners because they
tend to attract debris.
♦Get under a piece of sturdy furniture such as a workbench or heavy
table.
♦Use your arms to protect your head and neck.
If at work or school:
♦Go to the basement or to an inside hallway at the lowest level.
♦Avoid wide rooms such as auditoriums, cafeterias or large hallways.
♦Get under a piece of sturdy furniture such as a workbench, heavy
table or desk.
♦Use your arms to protect your head and neck.
If outdoors:
♦If possible, get inside a building.
♦If shelter is not available or there is no time to get indoors, lie in a
ditch or low-lying area or crouch near a strong building.
♦Use your arms to protect your head and neck.
If in a car or truck:
♦Never try to outdrive a tornado. Tornadoes can change direction
quickly and can lift up a car or truck and toss it through the air.
♦Get out of the car immediately and take shelter in a nearby building,
ditch or low-lying area away from the vehicle.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionProtecting Homes From Lightning
WHAT TO DO BEFORE LIGHTNING STRIKES
Three protective measures will
help safeguard your home from
lightning: a lightning-rod and
ground system, a grounded TV
antenna and grounded
appliances. These devices are
particularly important if you live
in an area subject to frequent or
severe thunderstorms. Unless
you have the expertise, have
only licensed electrical
contractors install these
systems.LIGHTNING-ROD SYSTEMS
Lightning-rod and ground systems, if properly installed, are believed to be
at least 90 percent effective in preventing damage should a lightning strike
occur. They were more common years ago, when they were sold door to
door with high pressure tactics. Today, fewer homes have such systems,
perhaps because people feel the $1,500-plus cost outweighs the risk. Just
what is the risk? One estimate says a Wisconsin home is likely to be
struck by lightning once every 350 years.
A good lightning protection system has five components:
♦The lightning rod or air terminal intended to intercept the strike.
Some metal roofs can be used as air terminals.
♦A cable capable of conducting the electrical charge safely to the
ground.
♦The ground connector, which provides contact with the earth so that
the lightning can be safely dissipated.
♦The bonding between the first three components so that no side flash
occurs at the joints because of a poor connection.
♦The lightning arrester or surge protector. Arresters guard against
damage that may occur from lightning that strikes a nearby power
line, phone line or other wire entering the house.
Quality components and proper installation are both important. If you are
purchasing a system be sure it has been approved by the Lightning
Protection Institute or Underwriters Laboratory. Also be sure that the
contractor is listed or certified by one or both of these groups.
GROUNDED TV ANTENNAS
Even if you have a lightning rod system, outdoor television antennas
should be grounded. The “core of protection” created by a grounded high
point probably extends downward at a 45-degree angle all around the high
point. A grounded antenna is no substitute for a lightning-rod system,
however.
If you have a lightning-rod and ground system, the TV can be grounded by
connecting the mast to the rod system. The ribbon lead-in should run
through the arrester; the arrester should be grounded to one of the
lightning-rod grounds. The arrester should be located at a lower level
(closer to the earth) than the TV set.
University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative Extension TORNADOES -PREPARATION
more informationAdditional resources:
Your county Extension office, your
electric power supplier, licensed
electrical contractors, the Lightning
Protection InstituteGROUNDED APPLIANCES
Appliances are more frequently burned out by electrical surges from
nearby lightning strikes than from direct lightning. Lightning does not have
to strike the distribution line to cause such a surge. To protect appliances,
have a “secondary lightning arrester” installed in the service wires at the
point where they drop to the house. Your electric power supplier can tell
you where to purchase these secondary arresters and what kinds would be
best for your electrical system.
SURGE PROTECTORS
A relatively inexpensive way to protect electronic equipment from power
surges is though use of surge protectors. These devices are typically
attached between the appliance and the wall outlet. They protect delicate
electronic components in appliances such as microwave ovens, computers
and VCRs from power surges caused by lightning or other sources. You
can purchase surge protectors at computer and office-equipment stores.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionStandby Electric Generators
A SOURCE OF EMERGENCY POWER FOR FARMERS
An emergency source of power
is important for any farm with
mechanically ventilated
production facilities, bulk milk
handling equipment, mechanical
feeding equipment or facilities
requiring constant and
continuous heat (such as
brooders). On such a farm, a
standby electric generator is a
good investment, possibly
preventing costly losses during
a power failure.
During disasters such as flood
or tornado, relief agencies may
provide generators to farmers on
an emergency basis.TYPES OF GENERATORS
Standby generators are either engine driven or tractor driven. Either type
can be stationary or portable. Engine driven units can be either manual or
automatic start. Gasoline-, LP gas- (bottled gas) and diesel-fueled engines
are available.
Generators must provide the same type of power at the same voltage and
frequency as that supplied by power lines. This is usually 120/240 volt,
single phase, 60 cycle alternating current (AC). An air-cooled engine is
often used for generators up to 15 kilowatts. A liquid-cooled engine is
necessary for generators larger than 15 kilowatts. Engine capacity of 2 to 2
1/4 hp with the proper drive system must be available for each 1,000 watts
of generator output.
SIZE OF GENERATORS
A full-load system will handle the entire farmstead load. Automatic
engine-powered, full-load systems will begin to furnish power immediately,
or up to 30 seconds after power is off. Smaller and less expensive
part-load systems may be enough to handle essential equipment during an
emergency.
Power-take-off (PTO) generators are about half as costly as
engine-operated units. Under a part-load system, only the most essential
equipment is operated at one time. For most farms, this type of system is
adequate, provided the generator is sized to start the largest motor. For
example, the milk cooler or ventilation fan would need to be operated
continuously, but the operation of the silo unloader and mechanical feeding
system could be postponed until the milking chores are completed. PTO
units can be mounted on a trailer.
INSTALLATION
Wiring and equipment must be installed in accordance with the National
Electrical Code, local ordinances and the requirements of your power
supplier. It is essential that you have the proper equipment for
disconnecting the generator from public utility lines. Most companies
require the installation of a double-pole double-throw transfer switch or its
equivalent for this purpose. Check with your electrician or power supply
representative for installation, installation instructions and inspection.

“Standby Power,” Illinois Farm
Electrification Council, Fact Sheet #2.LOCATION AND SAFETY FEATURES
♦Large engine generators should be located in a building, preferably a
heated building.
♦Inlet and outlet air ducts must be large enough to carry off excess
heat. They should be open at least a half a square foot for each 1,000
watts of generator capacity.
♦Combustion fumes must be carried outdoors safely. Exhaust pipes
must be at least 6 inches from combustible material.
OPERATION
An automatic standby unit should start automatically when power fails, and
stop when power is restored. When using an engine-driven generator with
a manual start, or when using a tractor driven unit, follow this procedure
when power fails:
♦Call your power supplier and advise them of the conditions.
♦Turn off or disconnect all electrical equipment.
♦Position the tractor or engine for belt of PTO drive.
♦Start the unit and bring the generator up to proper speed (1,800 or
3,600 rps). Check on arrangement to carry off exhaust fumes. Be sure
there is no danger of fire. The voltmeter will indicate when the
generator is ready to carry the load.
♦Put the transfer switch in the generator position.
♦Start the largest electrical motor first, adding other loads when each is
up to operating speed. Do not add too much too fast. If the generator
cuts out for any reason, repeat the second, third and fourth steps
above.
♦Check the voltmeter frequently. If voltage falls below 200 volts for
240 volt service or below 100 volts for 120 volt service, reduce the
load on the generator by turning off some electrical equipment.
♦When commercial power is restored, put the transfer switch in normal
power position. Then stop the standby unit.
MAINTENANCE
♦Keep the unit clean and in good running order at all times so it will
be ready for immediate use. Dust and dirt accumulations on the motor
can cause it to overheat when operated.
♦Follow maintenance instructions in manufacturer's manual. A short
operation at set intervals will keep the engine in good operating
condition. Regularly scheduled warm-ups are necessary to keep a
standby engine in working order.

FOOD SAFETY IN THE EYE OF A DISASTER
Damaged food supplies, water
contamination and temporary
loss of refrigeration may be
critical issues for you as a
tornado survivor. While
structural damage may be the
initial focus in your home, some
basic precautions can keep your
food stores safe and your family
healthy as you begin clean-up
efforts.
If you live in an area susceptible
to tornadoes, keep an adequate
supply of food, bottled water
and emergency equipment on
hand. This includes enough
canned food to last four to five
days, a hand can opener,
battery-powered radio, extra
batteries and emergency
cooking equipment like a camp

SUPPLIES
The water supply may be disrupted or contaminated after an area has
sustained a tornado. Food in damaged buildings and homes may be
hazardous. Follow these precautions:
♦Drink only approved or chlorinated water.
♦Consider all water from wells, cisterns and other delivery systems in
the disaster area unsafe until tested.
♦Check foods and discard any containing particles of glass or slivers of
other debris.
♦Discard canned foods with broken seams.
REFRIGERATION AND FREEZER CONCERNS
If the electricity is off to the refrigerator or freezer, follow these
guidelines:
♦Discard refrigerated meats, seafood, milk, soft cheese, eggs, prepared
foods and cookie doughs if they have been kept above 40 degrees F.
for over two hours. Also discard thawed items that have warmed
above 40 degrees F., with the exception of breads and plain cakes.
♦Discard any refrigerated items that turn moldy or have an unusual
odor or appearance.
♦Refreeze partially or completely frozen foods.
♦Cold but fully thawed, uncooked meat, fish or poultry should be
checked for off-odor. If there is none, cook and eat or cook and
refreeze.
♦Discard combination dishes such as stews, casseroles and meat pies if
they are thawed.
♦Refreeze thawed (but cold) juices, baked goods, and dairy items such
as cream, cheese and butter.
♦Do not refreeze thawed vegetables unless ice crystals remain. Cook
and use them if there are no off-odors.

clean and disinfect dishwasher-safe items. Regarding other items, or all
items if you don't have a dishwasher, follow these steps:
♦Wash all items in a a strong detergent solution. Use a brush to
remove dirt. Rinse in hot water.
♦Immerse glass, porcelain, china, plastic dinnerware and enamelware
for 10 minutes in a disinfecting solution of 2 tablespoons of chlorine
bleach per gallon of hot water.
♦Disinfect silverware, metal utensils, and pots and pans by boiling in
water for 10 minutes. Chlorine bleach should not be used in this case
because it reacts with many metals and causes them to darken.
♦Air-dry dishes. Do not use a towel.
♦Discard and replace soft, porous plastic or wood items saturated by
floodwater, since they cannot be sanitized. These include baby bottles,
nipples and pacifiers.
♦If cupboards and counters come in contact with floodwater, clean and
rinse them with a chlorine bleach solution before storing dishes.

Additional resources:
Your county agricultural agentROOF
♦Damaged or missing shingles. Check asphalt shingles for cracks at the
butt end, where they may have been weakened from flexing. Make
sure individual shingles have not blown off. Thoroughly inspect
shingles on the ridge, gable ends and eaves.
♦Loose nails on metal roofing. Inspect the entire roof, with particular
attention to gable ends, eaves and ridge cap. If nails have worked
loose, re-nail them as soon as possible. If the nails don't hold when
hammered back in, use #12 or #14 metal screws to fill old nail holes.
(Use aluminum screws on aluminum and steel screws on steel.) In
addition to screws, re-nail 3 to 4 inches away with ring or screw-type
nails.
♦Potential leaks. On a sunny day, check the roof carefully from inside
with the building doors closed. While looking for holes in the roof,
inspect the ridge, gable ends and eaves for possible structural
separation.
FOUNDATION
Inspect the foundation. The plate should not be separated from the
studding where the foundation meets the walls. On block foundations,
inspect mortar joints to make sure the block with the plate bolt in it hasn't
separated from the wall. On stone or concrete foundations, check to see
that the plate bolts have not worked loose.
SILO
Make sure the silo is still plumb. Look for loose hoops. Inspect the roof to
be sure it remains fastened to the silo. Inspect the base of metal silos
inside and outside for hairline cracks. If there is rust around the base,
remove it with a wire brush. Then check for cracks and apply a rust
preventive paint. Look for new cracks in the plaster of empty concrete
stave silos.
INTERIOR
Inspect the interior of buildings for structural damage. Using a good light,
check the framing. Look for ridge separation, loose knee braces and loose
rafters where the rafters join the walls.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative Extension TORNADOES -CLEAN-UP/REPAIRAssessing Roof Damage After a Tornado
REPAIR STRATEGIES FOR HOMEOWNERS
If your roof has suffered
structural damage from a
tornado, make family safety your
first priority. In some cases,
such as a partially collapsed
roof, you may need to relocate
until repairs are made. Next,
report damage to your insurance
company. If you must make
temporary repairs before an
insurance adjuster's visit, take
photographs or make a
videotape of damage. You will
need good records for insurance
claims, applications for disaster
assistance and income tax
deductions.WORKING WITH YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY
Call your insurance agent about the damage to your home and roof so that
your agent can file a claim. The sooner you talk to your agent, the sooner
your claim will be filed and an adjuster will inspect your damage. The
amount of coverage for your loss depends on your policy. But even if you
don't have full coverage, your agent may be able to give you advice on
where to get help with repairs.
Because some damage may not be discovered until repairs are underway,
don't be in a hurry to settle your insurance claim. Instead, keep your
insurance agent apprised of repair estimates and repairs; have your building
contractor or roofer discuss repairs and estimates with your agent if
possible. Only settle your claim when you feel all repairs are known and/or
made. That way, if related problems such as water damage, foundation
damage or the need for new wiring are uncovered during reconstruction,
your insurance settlement may reflect these as well. (See the fact sheet
“Insurance Coverage and Making a Claim.”)
TEMPORARY REPAIRS
If temporary repairs are needed before the professionals arrive, be sure that
only a physically able person is allowed on the roof. Unsteadiness on the
ladder or roof can lead to severe injuries. If the roof is sagging from
structural damage, wait for a professional to assess damage and make
repairs; a sagging roof may unexpectedly collapse.
Cover holes in the roof, walls or windows with boards, tarps or plastic
sheeting. If possible, place tarps or plastic over the ridge so rain rolls off.
Nail down plastic sheets or trash bags with strips of wood and secure them
with duct tape. If the holes are large, you may need to support the plastic
in the center to keep it from ripping from the weight of the rain.
If sections of the roof or floors are sagging, have a contractor or other
knowledgeable person brace weak areas. Improper bracing may increase
damage and the chance of injury, so do not attempt this work unless you
are experienced in structural repairs.
PERMANENT REPAIRS
If damage is limited to non-structural elements such as shingles, flashing
and sheathing, contact a professional roofer for the work. If damage is
structural in nature, hire a general contractor. (See the fact sheet, “Hiring

roof structure or portions of the roof as necessary, in addition to handling
related repairs. If the contractor does not have roofing expertise (e.g.
shingles, sheathing, etc.), he may subcontract this portion of the work to a
specialist.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative Extensionwinter stormsWinter Storm Preparedness and Response
SAFETY AT HOME AND WHILE TRAVELING
Winter storms are worth
serious consideration in
Wisconsin. Blizzards, heavy
snow, freezing rain and
sub-zero temperatures hit hard
and frequently across the
state. Even if you think you are
safe and warm at home, a
winter storm can become
dangerous if the power is cut
off. With a little planning, you
can protect yourself and your
family from the many hazards
of winter weather, both at
home and on the road.BE AWARE OF THE FORECAST
♦Winter weather advisory. Formerly called a “travelers' advisory,” this
alert may be issued by the National Weather Service for a variety of
severe conditions. Weather advisories may be announced for snow,
blowing and drifting snow, freezing drizzle, freezing rain (when less
than ice storm conditions are expected), or a combination of weather
events.
♦Winter storm watch. Severe winter weather conditions may affect your
area (freezing rain, sleet or heavy snow may occur either separately or
in combination).
♦Winter storm warning. Severe winter weather conditions are imminent.
♦Freezing rain or freezing drizzle. Rain or drizzle is likely to freeze upon
impact, resulting in a coating of ice glaze on roads and all other
exposed objects.
♦Sleet.Small particles of ice, usually mixed with rain. If enough sleet
accumulates on the ground, it makes travel hazardous.
♦Blizzard warning. Sustained wind speeds of at least 35 miles per hour
are accompanied by considerable falling and/or blowing snow. This is
the most perilous winter storm, with visibility dangerously restricted.
♦Wind chill. A strong wind combined with a temperature slightly below
freezing can have the same chilling effect as a temperature nearly 50
degrees lower in a calm atmosphere. The combined cooling power of
the wind and temperature on exposed flesh is called the wind-chill
factor.
BE PREPARED AT HOME
♦Keep a battery-powered radio and flashlights in working order; stock
extra batteries.
♦Store food that can be prepared without an electric or gas stove.
♦Stock emergency water and cooking supplies.
♦Have candles and matches available in case of a power outage.
♦Have sufficient heating fuel; regular fuel sources may be cut off.
♦Have some kind of emergency heating equipment and fuel (a kerosene
heater, a gas fireplace or wood-burning stove or fireplace) so you can
keep at least one room of your house warm if power is cut off. (See the
fact sheet “Staying Warm in an Unheated House.”)

♦Keep calm and stay in your
vehicle. Do not attempt to
walk out of a blizzard. You are
much more likely to be found
by staying in your vehicle.
♦Keep fresh air in your
vehicle — especially if you are
using a candle, solid fuel or
other type of heating device
— to prevent carbon
monoxide build-up and
oxygen starvation.
♦Run motor and heater
sparingly and only with the
down-wind window open for
ventilation. Make sure snow
has not blocked the exhaust
pipe.
♦Turn on dome light at night.
This helps make the vehicle
visible for work crews.
♦Keep watch. Do not permit
all occupants to sleep at
once.
♦Exercise. Clapping hands
and moving arms and legs
vigorously will help keep you
awake and improve
circulation.

“Winter Travel Awareness,”BE PREPARED IN YOUR CAR
Keep your car “winterized” with antifreeze. Carry a winter car kit that
includes a windshield scraper, flashlight, candle and matches, tow chain or
rope, shovel, tire chains, blanket, extra mittens, bag of sand or salt, a
fluorescent distress flag and an emergency flare.
RIDING OUT A STORM AT HOME
If you are isolated at home, listen to the radio or television for updates on
weather conditions. Conserve fuel by keeping your house cooler than usual
and by temporarily “closing off” heat to some rooms. When emergency
heating methods must be used, maintain adequate ventilation to avoid build-up
of toxic fumes. (See the fact sheet, “Staying Warm in an Unheated House.”)
Dress accordingly. Layer your clothing; many layers of thin clothing are
warmer than single layers of thick clothing. If you need to go outdoors or the
heat is off indoors, wear mittens; they are warmer than gloves. Wear a hat;
most body heat is lost through the top of the head. Cover your mouth with
scarves to protect your lungs from directly inhaling extremely cold air.
If shoveling snow isn't critical, don't do it. If you must shovel snow, take your
time and lift small amounts. Over-exertion can bring on a heart attack — a
major cause of death during and after winter storms.
IF TRAVELING IN BAD WEATHER
♦Use public transportation, if possible. Try not to travel alone during a
storm.
♦Make sure your vehicle is in good operating condition, winterized,
properly serviced and equipped with snow or all weather tires. Be sure
your headlights, taillights and windows are clean so you can see and be
seen.
♦Listen to your radio for weather information.
♦Always fill your gas tank before entering open country, even for short
distances. You are less likely to get stranded with a full tank. If you do
get stranded, you will have enough gas to run the motor and heat the
vehicle.
♦Let someone know your departure time, expected arrival time and route.
♦Seek shelter immediately if the storm seems severe. Don't be foolhardy.
♦Drive carefully and defensively. Don't try to save time by traveling faster
than road and weather conditions permit.
♦Never carry spare fuel inside the vehicle or the trunk. Gasoline fumes
can build up and cause a violent explosion.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionProtecting Plumbing During a Winter Storm
CARE OF UTILITIES AND APPLIANCES WHEN THE POWER IS OUT
If the heat will be off in your
home for several days during a
winter storm, you should protect
exposed plumbing, sewage
systems and appliances from
freezing and subsequent
damage. Frozen pipes could
become a problem once the
temperature inside the home
falls below 40 degrees F.
If some pipes have frozen,
despite the fact that power has
returned or exists, there are
some simple measures to take.
But whenever possible, get an
expert for plumbing work or
repairs.REDUCE THE CHANCE OF FROZEN PIPES
Follow these steps to reduce the chance of pipes freezing during a power
failure:
♦Shut off the water at the main valve, or turn off the well pump if it is
in the house.
♦Turn the water heater off. An explosion could result if the heater is
left on without water in the system. You will find either an electrical
switch or gas valve for shutting off the appliance.
♦Open all the faucets on the lower level, then the upper level. You
may want to collect the water for household use.
♦Insulate undrainable pipes around their main valves. Use newspaper,
blankets or housing insulation.
Unlike summer homes and cottages, modern housing is not usually
designed for easy winterization. For this reason, you should contact a
plumber or other expert if the house will be without heat for an extended
period of time. Critical measures include: draining of toilets, water
softening units, drain traps, sump pumps, heaters, humidifiers, dishwashers
and other appliances that use water.
WHEN PIPES FREEZE
Under normal circumstances, most of us never have to worry about a
frozen water pipe. Our plumbing pipes are on interior walls and are
insulated well enough that water does not freeze. But frozen pipes may
become a concern if the heat is off or if water pipes run through unheated
crawl spaces, floors over garages or in outside walls.
If pipes do freeze:
♦Shut off the water supply and open faucets to the frozen pipes;
♦Warm them with a heat lamp, blow dryer or portable heater;
♦Do not use boiling water, propane torches or any open flame to thaw
frozen pipes;
♦Apply only moderate heat and expect to wait for several hours;
♦Open sink cabinets to let in warm air.

more informationAdditional resources:
Your county family living agentIf pipes have burst before you could take preventive action, immediately
turn off their water supply. Try to locate the areas that need repair and call
a plumber.
LONG-TERM SOLUTIONS
The long-term solution for frozen pipes is to provide adequate insulation
and heat. Methods may include wrapping pipes with insulation material
and installing weather stripping, insulation and heat to the room. A
temporary or last resort solution is the use of electric heating tape, which
can be wrapped around the pipes and energized when sub-zero weather is
predicted. You can also leave faucets connected to exposed pipes trickling
when low temperatures are forecasted. If the pipes are under an enclosed
sink, open the door and use a fan to blow warm air from the room toward
the pipes.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionIce Dam Prevention on Roofs
SIMPLE WAYS TO ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEM
Ice dams occur when a
snow-covered roof over the attic
is warmer than the eaves — the
overhang of a roof. If the roof is
warm, it will cause the snow to
melt and run under snow along
the roof. When the melted snow
hits the cooler eaves, it freezes.
As ice builds up on eaves, it
eventually traps water behind it.
The water backs up under
shingles and finds its way
through seams in the building
paper and roof decking to enter
the attic and living area.
Wallpaper, plaster and paint
surfaces may be damaged in the
process. Fortunately, there are
several ways to remedy the
problem.
Additional resources:
Your county Extension officeWHEN SEEPAGE HAS ALREADY BEGUN
If you have an immediate problem with ice dams, you should remove the
snow from the part of the roof directly above the ice dam. This limits the
amount of water that can collect behind the dam.
♦Remove the snow using a roof rake, hoe or push broom. Roof rakes
have long handles that allow you to stay on the ground when clearing
a single-story roof. You can purchase them at hardware stores.
♦Avoid using sharp instruments, such as axes, to break channels
through the ice. This is likely to cause roof and structure damage.
PREVENTION
A cooler attic area will help decrease problems with ice dams. Here are
two ways to keep attics cool:
♦Increase insulation in the attic to at least 12 inches. Also, close any
thermal shortcuts —openings that allow air to move from the heated
part of the house into the attic. Chases around chimneys, plumbing
vents, junction boxes for ceiling light fixtures, attic hatches and
ceiling fan mounts are common thermal shortcuts.
♦Create adequate attic ventilation to remove any heat that escapes into
the attic. One square foot of free ventilation opening is recommended
for every 150 square feet of attic space. Ventilation should be divided
between eaves and the house ridge to take advantage of the fact that
warm air rises. When installing eave or soffit vents, be sure that the
opening is not blocked by insulation. You can do that by installing a
cardboard or plastic channel over the insulation lined up with each
vent.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative Extension WINTERSTORMS-HOMEPROTECTIONStaying Warm in an Unheated House
COPING WITH A POWER OUTAGE IN WINTER
During severe winter storms,
your home heating system could
be inoperative for as long as
several days. To minimize
discomfort and possible health
problems during this time,
conserve body heat by dressing
warmly; find or improvise an
alternative heat source, such as
a fireplace or electric space
heater; confine heating to a
single room; and keep safety a
foremost consideration. While
chances of freezing to death in
your home are small, there's a
greater danger of death by fire,
lack of oxygen or carbon
monoxide poisoning.THINK “SAFETY FIRST”
Safety is of extreme importance in a heating emergency. Follow these
precautions:
♦Do not burn anything larger than candles inside your home without
providing adequate ventilation to the outside.
♦Any type of heater (except electric) should be vented. Connect the
stove pipe to a chimney flue if at all possible. (Many older homes
have capped pipe thimbles in rooms once heated by stoves.) Or hook
up your stove to the flue entrance of the non-functioning furnace pipe.
If no other alternative exists, consider extending a stove pipe through
a window. Replace the window glass with a metal sheet and run the
temporary stove pipe through the metal.
♦If you use a catalytic or unvented heater, cross-ventilate by opening a
window an inch on each side of the room. It is better to let in some
cold air than to run the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning.
♦Do not use a gas or electric oven or surface units for heating. A gas
oven may go out or burn inefficiently, leading to carbon monoxide
poisoning. An electric oven was not designed for space heating.
♦Do not burn outdoor barbecue materials such as charcoal briquettes
inside — even in a fireplace.
♦Do not try to use bottled gas in natural gas appliances unless you
have converted the appliances for such use. Also, flues and piping
suitable for gas burning appliances may be unsafe for use with
higher-temperature oil, coal or wood smoke.
♦Have one person watch for fire whenever alternative heat sources are
used. One person should also stay awake to watch for fire and to
make sure ventilation is adequate. If the designated person feels
drowsy or has a headache, it may be a sign of inadequate ventilation.
♦Keep firefighting materials on hand. These may include: dry powder
fire extinguishers, a tarp or heavy blanket, sand, salt, baking soda and
water.
CONSERVE BODY HEAT
Put on extra clothing. If cold is severe, your bed may be the warmest
place. Use extra blankets and coverings to trap body heat; this is an
especially good way to keep children warm. Farm families might consider
taking refuge in the relative warmth of the livestock barn.

SOURCE
You may have alternative heating resources around your home.
Possibilities include:
♦fireplace, space heater, catalytic camp stove
♦wood, gas or oil heater
♦gas-fired hot water heater
PROVIDE FUEL
Some common materials that could be used for fuel include:
♦firewood, newspapers, magazines
♦camp stove fuel, kerosene
♦wood chips, straw, corncobs
You can burn coal in a fireplace or stove if you make a grate to hold it,
allowing air to circulate underneath. “Hardware cloth” screening placed on
a standard wood grate will keep coal from falling through.
Tightly rolled newspapers or magazines can be used as paper “logs.” Stack
them as you would stack firewood to allow for air circulation.
If the heating situation becomes critical, consider burning wood, including
lumber or furniture.
SELECT A ROOM TO BE HEATED
To increase efficiency of available heat, close off all rooms except the one
to be heated. When selecting a room, consider the following:
♦If using a vented stove or space heater, select a room with a stove or
chimney flue.
♦Confine emergency heat to a small area.
♦Try to select a room on the “warm” side of the house, away from
prevailing winds. Avoid rooms with large windows or uninsulated
walls. Interior bathrooms probably have the lowest air leakage and
heat loss. Your basement may be a warm place in cold weather
because the earth acts as insulation and minimizes heat loss.
♦Isolate the room from the rest of the house by keeping doors closed,
hanging bedding or heavy drapes over entryways, or by erecting
temporary partitions of cardboard or plywood.
♦Hang drapes, bedding or shower curtains over doors and windows,

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionWinter Power Failure on the Farm
KEEPING ANIMALS AND EQUIPMENT SAFE
A winter power failure or fuel
shortage can cause problems on
farms, but being prepared can
keep problems to a minimum.
Ideally you should have a
standby electric generator for
emergency power. For ideas on
types of generators and their
operation, see the fact sheet
“Using Standby Electric
Generators.” Assuming you have
no power, take the following
precautions to keep animals and
equipment safe.POULTRY AND LIVESTOCK
To protect poultry and livestock during a power failure:
♦Ventilate buildings. Do not close buildings tight to conserve heat,
since animals could suffocate from lack of oxygen. Clear ice and
snow from all vents because oxygen will eventually be used up in
mechanically ventilated production facilities. Then open vents to
facilitate natural air flow.
♦Provide water. All animals, especially cattle, need plenty of water
during cold weather. It may be possible to drive your water pump
with a small gasoline engine and a belt. Otherwise, you will need to
haul water.
If you have an outside source of water, cattle can be turned out to drink it.
Be sure to place sand or other gritty material on icy feedlots to provide
good footing. Whatever the source of water, watch that it remains unfrozen
so animals can drink it.
♦Provide heat. Use camp stoves and heaters as emergency heat sources
for brooders. Plan ahead to have this equipment ready when needed.
♦Provide feed. Animals need extra energy for body heat during severe
or prolonged cold weather, especially if they are outside without
shelter. Mechanical feeders will be inoperable during a power failure.
Provide for emergency feeding procedures.
EQUIPMENT
Unplug or turn off all electric equipment to prevent damage when power is
restored.
If you use portable space heaters for supplemental heat, close off the fuel
valve as soon as possible after power is interrupted. (On models not
equipped with safety shut-offs, and especially on some models with gravity
feed fuel systems, fuel continues to flow even when the burner is
inoperative. An explosion or fire could result when power is restored.)
STORING MILK
♦Request that the dairy pick up milk as soon as possible.
♦Consider adding a standby power generator to handle vital electric
equipment.
University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative Extension WINTERSTORMS-HOME/FARMSAFETY
more informationAdditional resources:
Your county agricultural agentEven if you are short of extra milk storage facilities, do not store milk in
stock tanks or other containers. Dairy plants may not accept milk that has
been stored in anything other than regular milk storage containers. Check
with your local dairy about policy regarding emergency storage of milk.
If you are unable to cool your milk or have it picked up, check your tank
for souring each time you add milk to it. This check could mean the
difference between losing all or only part of your milk supply.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionAnimal Safety in Winter
PROVIDING ADEQUATE SHELTER, FEED AND WATER
For animals normally kept
outside during the winter, safety
can be a concern during
extended periods of severe cold,
snow or wet conditions. Wind
coupled with severe or
prolonged cold weather causes
additional stress on livestock,
increasing their needs for
shelter, food and water.PROVIDE SHELTER
Severe cold alone usually will not affect the performance of large animals
on full feed. Wind, however, can be a serious stress factor. A strong wind
has about the same effect on animals as exposure to a sudden drop in
temperature. In general, a 20 mph wind is about equivalent to a 30 degree
F. drop in temperature. Under extreme conditions, simple wind and snow
protection devices will not be 100 percent effective.
Move stock, especially the young, into sheltered areas during severe
periods of cold. Adequate shelter is important because animals' extremities
are subject to freezing during sub-zero weather. Extremities that become
wet or are normally wet are particularly subject to frostbite and freezing.
The loss of ears or tails could be of little economic significance, but
damage to male reproductive organs could impair the animals' fertility or
ability to breed. Frozen and chapped teats will impact milk production.
♦Shallow open-front sheds provide excellent shelters for livestock.
Such shelters should have slots along the eaves on the back side. The
openings provide ventilation and prevent snow from swirling into the
front of the shed. Use a 1-inch slot per 10 feet of building width.
Continuous ridge openings of 2 inches also are recommended for each
10 feet of building width.
♦Solid-sided feed wagons work well for temporary wind protection.
Attach plywood or locate bales of straw or feed at the bottom of the
wagon to block wind from moving under the wagon.
♦Windbreaks, properly oriented and laid out, or timber-covered
lowlands make good protection for range cattle. Unlike shed-type
shelters, windbreaks eliminate concerns about overcrowding or proper
ventilation.
♦Never close shelters tightly, since stock could suffocate from lack of
oxygen.
♦Additional bedding is helpful to keep animals insulated from the
ground and to keep them dry during cold periods.
PROVIDE EXTRA FEED
During severe or prolonged cold weather, animals need extra feed to
provide body heat and to maintain production weight gains. Provide them
University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative Extension WINTERSTORMS-HOME/FARMSAFETY
more informationAdditional resources:
Your county agricultural agent, the
National Weather Service for livestock
safety warningswith additional, higher fiber feeds such as hay or hay mixed with oat
straw. A good formula during cold weather is to increase feed 1 percent
for every degree drop in temperature below 32 degrees F. For example,
when the temperature drops from 32 degrees F. to 0 degrees, provide 32
percent more feed (break this into three or four feedings a day). Usually,
animals instinctively eat more feed if a storm is approaching.
Remember that mechanized feeders may be inoperable during power
failures. Unless you have a source of emergency power, you may need
extra labor to feed, water and care for animals by hand.
PROVIDE WATER
Dehydration is often a greater hazard during winter storms than cold or
suffocation. Cattle cannot lick enough snow to satisfy their water
requirements. They also will need more water if they are eating a
higher-fiber diet. Use heaters in water tanks to provide livestock with
enough water. Or, only pump out as much water as needed twice a day, to
avoid problems with freezing water. If pipes freeze or power is out, you
may need to haul water to animals.
WATCH YOUR LIVESTOCK
Watch your livestock carefully during winter storms and periods of severe
cold. Keep them moving. If you see them shivering, not moving or acting
abnormally, call your veterinarian. In particular, watch younger cattle for
signs of trouble.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionStandby Electric Generators
A SOURCE OF EMERGENCY POWER FOR FARMERS
An emergency source of power
is important for any farm with
mechanically ventilated
production facilities, bulk milk
handling equipment, mechanical
feeding equipment or facilities
requiring constant and
continuous heat (such as
brooders). On such a farm, a
standby electric generator is a
good investment, possibly
preventing costly losses during
a power failure.
During disasters such as flood
or tornado, relief agencies may
provide generators to farmers on
an emergency basis.TYPES OF GENERATORS
Standby generators are either engine driven or tractor driven. Either type
can be stationary or portable. Engine driven units can be either manual or
automatic start. Gasoline-, LP gas- (bottled gas) and diesel-fueled engines
are available.
Generators must provide the same type of power at the same voltage and
frequency as that supplied by power lines. This is usually 120/240 volt,
single phase, 60 cycle alternating current (AC). An air-cooled engine is
often used for generators up to 15 kilowatts. A liquid-cooled engine is
necessary for generators larger than 15 kilowatts. Engine capacity of 2 to 2
1/4 hp with the proper drive system must be available for each 1,000 watts
of generator output.
SIZE OF GENERATORS
A full-load system will handle the entire farmstead load. Automatic
engine-powered, full-load systems will begin to furnish power immediately,
or up to 30 seconds after power is off. Smaller and less expensive
part-load systems may be enough to handle essential equipment during an
emergency.
Power-take-off (PTO) generators are about half as costly as
engine-operated units. Under a part-load system, only the most essential
equipment is operated at one time. For most farms, this type of system is
adequate, provided the generator is sized to start the largest motor. For
example, the milk cooler or ventilation fan would need to be operated
continuously, but the operation of the silo unloader and mechanical feeding
system could be postponed until the milking chores are completed. PTO
units can be mounted on a trailer.
INSTALLATION
Wiring and equipment must be installed in accordance with the National
Electrical Code, local ordinances and the requirements of your power
supplier. It is essential that you have the proper equipment for
disconnecting the generator from public utility lines. Most companies
require the installation of a double-pole double-throw transfer switch or its
equivalent for this purpose. Check with your electrician or power supply
representative for installation, installation instructions and inspection.

Electrification Council, Fact Sheet #2.LOCATION AND SAFETY FEATURES
♦Large engine generators should be located in a building, preferably a
heated building.
♦Inlet and outlet air ducts must be large enough to carry off excess
heat. They should be open at least a half a square foot for each 1,000
watts of generator capacity.
♦Combustion fumes must be carried outdoors safely. Exhaust pipes
must be at least 6 inches from combustible material.
OPERATION
An automatic standby unit should start automatically when power fails, and
stop when power is restored. When using an engine-driven generator with
a manual start, or when using a tractor driven unit, follow this procedure
when power fails:
♦Call your power supplier and advise them of the conditions.
♦Turn off or disconnect all electrical equipment.
♦Position the tractor or engine for belt of PTO drive.
♦Start the unit and bring the generator up to proper speed (1,800 or
3,600 rps). Check on arrangement to carry off exhaust fumes. Be sure
there is no danger of fire. The voltmeter will indicate when the
generator is ready to carry the load.
♦Put the transfer switch in the generator position.
♦Start the largest electrical motor first, adding other loads when each is
up to operating speed. Do not add too much too fast. If the generator
cuts out for any reason, repeat the second, third and fourth steps
above.
♦Check the voltmeter frequently. If voltage falls below 200 volts for
240 volt service or below 100 volts for 120 volt service, reduce the
load on the generator by turning off some electrical equipment.
♦When commercial power is restored, put the transfer switch in normal
power position. Then stop the standby unit.
MAINTENANCE
♦Keep the unit clean and in good running order at all times so it will
be ready for immediate use. Dust and dirt accumulations on the motor
can cause it to overheat when operated.
♦Follow maintenance instructions in manufacturer's manual. A short
operation at set intervals will keep the engine in good operating
condition. Regularly scheduled warm-ups are necessary to keep a
standby engine in working order.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionWinter Kill of Alfalfa
PROMOTING WINTER HARDINESS AND MANAGING DAMAGE
Winter kill of alfalfa cannot be
avoided entirely in a bad year,
but you can minimize its
destruction with good
manage-ment practices.
Frequency of cutting, date of
last cutting, and fertilizing are all
factors you can control before
the first freeze. Once damage is
done, careful assessment of
your stands can increase your
success with reseeding.
Contributors to winter kill
include low temperatures, ice
cover and repeated freezing and
thawing. When repeated freezing
and thawing cause ice heave,
the crown of the plant is forced
out of the soil and alfalfa roots
may break.
Disease also is a contributor to
winter kill. The weather
conditions described above can
lead to disease; but conversely,
stands that already are diseased
are more susceptible to winter
kill. Typical diseases include
bacterial wilt, fusarium wilt,
phytophthora and root rot.PREVENTION OF WINTER KILL
Factors affecting winter kill include:
♦Age of the stand. The younger the stand, the greater its winter
hardiness.
♦Alfalfa variety. Varieties can make a difference; choose proven winter
hardy varieties. For up-to-date information, see the annual
Cooperative Extension publication, “Forage Variety Update for
Wisconsin.”
♦Soil fertility. High soil fertility can minimize the chances of winter
kill. Use a soil test to be sure potassium levels are in the optimum
range. A fall application of fertilizer can be helpful. Adjust fertilizers
for the amount of annual growth.
♦Cutting frequency for the previous season. The more frequently stands
are cut, the more susceptible they are to winter kill. Try to let the
alfalfa mature to 10 percent bloom at one harvest to rebuild the stand
condition.
♦Date of last fall cutting. A late fall cutting is not recommended,
particularly if you cut frequently during the season. If possible, take
your last cutting before Sept. 1. If you must cut late in the season, try
to cut high (leaving 6 to 8 inches of stubble). This leaves a layer of
insulation for the crown. The higher stems also can reduce suffocation
when ice cover is a problem.
♦The amount of growth prior to killing frost. The greater the growth,
the better the chance of survival.
ASSESSING STANDS IN SPRING
After frost is out, inspect alfalfa plants for root and crown condition. If
plant roots are not fleshy or off-white, plants are dead or dying. If plants
have considerable crown or root rot, they are likely to die. However, keep
in mind that after the first year of growth, all plants will show some signs
of crown rot; therefore, look for degree of severity.

Related publications:
UW-Extension publications–
“Alfalfa Management Guide,” (A3550);
“Forage Variety Update for Wisconsin,”

STANDDENSITYREQUIRED FOR MAXIMUM YIELD
First year after seeding 20-25 per square foot
Second year after seeding 12-15 per square foot
Third year after seeding 6-8 per square foot
If plant counts are significantly less than those in the chart, expect reduced
yields and increased weed problems. You may need to plow damaged
areas down and reseed. But keep in mind your first assessment is
preliminary; it is only intended to eliminate the worst stands. The final
assessment cannot be made until after plants begin to green up. Some
stands are weakened and show injury in spring. Others look healthy at
first, but die later in the spring.
CONSIDERATIONS FOR RESEEDING
Your reseeding options vary depending upon age of stands and when
winter kill occurred. If winter kill occurred in early winter, you have more
options for reseeding because there will be less autotoxicity in plants.
Autotoxicity is caused by an accumulation of one or more compounds that
inhibit germination and growth of new alfalfa seedlings. It is found in old
stands of alfalfa. Since it takes time for the autotoxic factor to degrade,
stands killed in early winter may have less autotoxicity than those killed in
spring.
♦If stands were seeded last year, disk to destroy remaining plants in
affected areas of the field and reseed alfalfa at a rate of 12 pounds
per acre. Use a variety with a high level of resistance (HR) to
phytophthora root rot and one that has been treated with the fungicide
Apron. It may be possible to reseed only affected areas of the field.
♦If stands were seeded two years ago, autotoxicity may be a problem.
If kill occurred in early winter, reseed as directed above. If kill
occurred toward spring or date of kill is unknown, disk areas to be
reseeded and wait two to three weeks before reseeding. Use an
Apron-treated alfalfa variety with a high level of resistance (HR) to
phytophthora root rot.
♦If stands were seeded three years ago or more, reseeding success is
likely to be reduced by autotoxicity. If stand kill occurred early in
winter, till areas to be reseeded and wait two to three weeks before
seeding. Use an Apron-treated alfalfa variety with a high level of
resistance (HR) to phytophthora root rot. The best option is to
interseed with red clover at 8 pounds per acre or with an annual or
perennial ryegrass at a seeding rate of 8 to 15 pounds per acre,
depending on density of remaining alfalfa stand. If winter kill
occurred in spring, consider seeding another crop, such as a grain or
annual forage like sorghum-sudan grass. Then reseed alfalfa in August
or next year.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionWinter Kill of Small Grains
PROMOTING WINTER HARDINESS AND MANAGING DAMAGE
Unstable winter temperatures
and lack of snow cover take
most of the blame for winter kill
of small grains. But other
variables play a part as well.
Two major factors are planting
dates and the grain varieties
used. Generally, early planting
yields more winter hardiness,
better stands and higher yields.
Grain varieties with excellent
winter hardiness can make a big
difference for growers as well.
Despite your best efforts,
however, winter kill may cause
serious damage. If stands are
thin, you have several options,
ranging from fertilizing to
replanting to applying for
disaster payments.PLANTING GUIDELINES FOR THE FALL
♦Test soil to determine fertility of field.
♦Control perennial weeds, such as quackgrass.
♦Use good tillage practices.
♦Fertilize to a yield goal of 100 to 150 bushels per acre.
a) Use nitrogen at 25 lb. per acre.
b) Use phosphorous and potassium at high levels prior to planting.
♦Select a variety with the highest yield for your area, as well as good
winter hardiness. Consult with your county Extension office for
current data as necessary. Public winter wheat varieties Glacier and
Merrimac, for example, are rated “excellent” for winter hardiness in
Wisconsin; Cardinal, Caldwell and Howell are rated “good.”
♦Plant at the optimum date for your area, considering location and
likelihood of aphid infestation. For high winter hardy varieties like
Glacier and Merrimac, for example, planting dates are:
a) Sept. 15-Oct. 10 in southern Wisconsin.
b) Sept. 10-Oct. 5 in central Wisconsin.
c) Sept.1-20 in northern Wisconsin.
Planting dates for varieties with medium winter hardiness, such as
Cardinal, Caldwell and Howell, are:
a) Sept. 1-15 in southern Wisconsin.
b) Aug. 25-Sept. 15 in central Wisconsin.
c) Aug. 20-Sept. 10 in northern Wisconsin.
Plant in 4- to 7-inch row spacings, incorporating tramlines for subsequent
management practices.
♦Plant 30 to 40 seeds per square foot.
ASSESSING THE STAND IN SPRING
♦Check stand density in the spring as soon as winter survival can be
rated.
a) If stand is adequate (more than 18 plants per foot of row), apply
25 lb. of nitrogen per acre just prior to or at tillering time
(Growth Stage 20).

Related publications:
UW-Extension publication “Small Grain
Varieties for Grain and Forage in
Wisconsin,” (A3397).b) If stand is poor (fewer than 18 plants per foot of row), apply up
to 50 lb. of nitrogen to promote tillering.
♦Use proper weed control measures if weeds are anticipated to be a
problem.
♦Apply an additional 50 to 75 pounds of nitrogen at stem elongation
(Growth Stage 30) for grain filling.
♦Apply fungicides as needed for disease control during the growing
season.
♦Harvest on time at optimum grain moisture.
♦Provide for adequate, safe storage space.
COMMON QUESTIONS
♦When isn't a crop worth saving? If you see fewer than six plants per
square foot, consider ripping them up and replanting something else,
such as spring wheat, barley or oats.
♦Should you interseed spring wheat if the stand is poor? Generally, the
disadvantages of interseeding outweigh the advantages. For one thing,
differences in maturation rates mean harvest loss and and a lesser
quality of wheat. Secondly, hard-red spring wheats and soft-red winter
wheats are used in different ways, making them difficult to sell as a
mixed-class wheat. If you plan to use the crop for feed, however, this
is not a serious concern.
♦Should you claim a loss through the Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service (ASCS)? If you are enrolled in the wheat
program and you had major damage from winter kill, this may be the
best solution. Consult with your county agricultural agent and ASCS
personnel if you need help making this decision. If the claim is
approved you may be able to collect a disaster payment, replant
spring small grains or corn and still protect your wheat base.
♦What weather conditions will increase the chances of winter kill?
a) A rapid drop in temperature in the fall instead of a gradual drop.
This will increase chances of winter kill because plants don't have
time to develop winter hardiness.
b) Lack of snow cover and repeated warming and freezing. These
conditions occur frequently in the months of February and March.
In some cases, plants will break dormancy and start growing
before winter conditions have ended. In other cases, plants may be
smothered by ice sheets, ponding and flooding that develop.

SOUND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES FOR PRODUCERS
Fire prevention is critical on any
farm, but sometimes overlooked
until it is too late. The heat and
smoke of fire, along with the
toxic gases and rapid loss of
oxygen, can kill quickly. Without
prevention and safe
management practices, you put
your own life at risk, as well as
that of family members,
employees and animals. On top
of that, your farm buildings,
equipment and means of earning
an income can be wiped out in
minutes. Safe management
practices can make the
difference.
For starters, you should:
♦Avoid “building in” fire
hazards in the initial
construc-tion of your farm
buildings and management
practices. For example, use all
noncombustible or
flame-retardent materials
possible. Also, keep motors and
machine tools free of dust and
grease.
♦Fight fire before it starts by
keeping all ignition sources
away from combustible material
in and around your farm
buildings.
♦Get proper fire insurance
coverage for your livestock,
buildings and equipment.MAKE TIME FOR INSPECTIONS AND FIRE
DRILLS
♦Invite your local fire department to your farm. Let them get
acquainted with your facilities and help identify any fire hazards. Ask
for their input in making your operation more fire-safe and fire-proof.
♦Develop and carry out a fire safety inspection for animal buildings
and other buildings. Follow a routine preventive maintenance
schedule and checklist for fire hazards.
♦Conduct regular fire drills, so all family members and employees
know what they should do. After a drill, hold a meeting to discuss
improvements in procedures and equipment. Educate yourself and
others about fire safety practices.
♦Update and upgrade your farm buildings in accordance with the
latest National Electrical Code. Use all noncombustible materials.
Install a lightning protection system and inspect it periodically.
KEEP THINGS CLEAN AND IN GOOD REPAIR
♦Make good housekeeping part of your daily routine. Cut down and
remove weeds and brush from around buildings. Keep work areas
clean, dry and unobstructed. Never block exits or aisles, even for a
few minutes. If you have a poultry building, check for excessive
accumulations of dust, down feathers or cobwebs on sides, roof or
rafters. Find a place for everything and keep it there.
♦Test your fire or smoke alarm system at least once a year. Likewise,
flush outside private fire hydrants at least once a year. Check fire
doors and shutters on a regular basis to make sure they are free of
any obstructions and in good operating condition. Check all water
control valves and air and water pressures of automatic sprinkler
systems every week.
♦Make sure that power needs for ventilation, feed distribution and
other functions are met without overloading your electrical system.
Follow the National Electrical Code. Use good material and proper
fuse size or circuit breaker rating. Use junction boxes at all splice
points. Use waterproof wiring and receptacles, enclosed electric
motors and similar equipment in any buildings which are cleaned
periodically with high-pressure equipment.

Remember the phrase P-A-S-S if
you attempt to put out a small
fire with an extinguisher. P is for
pull the pin of the extinguisher
(or with some units, Press the
puncture lever or release the
lock hatch); A is for aim low or
point the unit's nozzle at the
base of the fire; S is for squeeze
the handle to release the
extinguishing agent; and the
other S is for sweep from side to
side. Keep the extinguisher
aimed at the base of the fire and
sweep back and forth until it
appears to be out. Never turn
your back on a small fire, even if
it looks as if it is out. Be
prepared in case it flashes again.

Association Catalog, available by
calling (800) 344-3555.♦Inspect all wiring and electric motors and appliances for exposed
wires, broken insulation, improper grounding and improper
installation. Equip motors with thermal overload relays or cutouts.
♦Check the heating system to make certain that every furnace or stove
is in good repair. See that ducts and air shafts are clean of dust and
debris, motors are cleaned and oiled (if necessary) each season, and
pulley belts are in good working order. Check gas and fuel oil
systems for leaks and unsafe installations. Keep all types of heating
devices and other equipment clean and in good condition.
MINIMIZE HAZARDS ON SITE
♦Strictly enforce a “no smoking” rule inside any buildings or areas
where flammable and combustible materials are stored. Never smoke
near storage, shipping or receiving areas where boxes or other
containers can easily start a fire.
♦Be extremely careful when handling gasoline. It is flammable and
explosive. If your clothing becomes contaminated with a flammable
material, change immediately. Never refuel gasoline engines while
they are running or hot.
♦Keep flammable liquids in labeled safety containers and store them in
approved flammable-liquid safety cabinets.
♦Keep above-ground fuel storage tanks at least 40 feet from buildings.
This setback minimizes the potential for fire spread and generally is
required for compliance with Wisconsin's Flammable and
Combustible Liquids Code, ILHR 10. For more information, contact
your regional storage tank inspector at the Department of Industry,
Labor and Human Relations.
KNOW YOUR FIRE EXTINGUISHERS
♦Select and provide proper fire extinguishers. Always make sure the
unit on the wall matches the type of fires that could develop in that
area. There are different types of extinguishers for different kinds of
fires. If you use the wrong unit on a fast-moving fire, you can cause
the fire to spread even faster.
♦Read the extinguisher's instructions to learn how to use the
extinguisher before a fire ever starts. Make sure all extinguishers are
serviced, maintained and tagged at intervals, not to exceed one year.
♦Know your limits and always think safety first. Fire extinguishers
cannot do the job of a local fire department. When a fire burns for
more than a couple of minutes, the heat starts to build up and
intensify. Once that happens, you are past a point of first aid. Get out
of the building and let firefighters handle the situation.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionFarmstead Evacuation During a Fire
SETTING PRIORITIES IN AN EMERGENCY
Fires are dangerous anywhere,
but on the farm they pose
unique perils for animals and
their owners. Toxic fumes can
kill or cause permanent lung
damage. Panicked animals
behave unpredictably or refuse
to respond to normal handling
approaches. They may trap
themselves and their rescuers in
a rapidly spreading fire.
Work with your local fire
department to minimize fire risk
on your farm. Formulate an
emergency fire plan and practice
it regularly with family members
and employees. Likewise,
conduct periodic fire safety
inspections. (See the fact sheet
“Fire Prevention and Safety on
the Farm.”) Above all, remember
that your first priority should
always be human safety—and
that includes you.PRIORITIES
People have been seriously injured or killed when trying to save animals,
grain or equipment on their farms. They forget that smoke and toxic fumes
can kill them in seconds.
♦Human safety, including your own life, must be your first priority.
Make sure you, your family members and employees are safe. Call
the fire department immediately and let the experts take control. If
you can use a fire extinguisher on a small fire, do so. But realize its
limitations in the face of a fast-moving blaze.
♦Your property, as a business investment, comes second. When your
farmstead is burning, it's time to make your hardest business
decisions. Firefighting crews may ask you which building to save
first, second, third, etc. Ask yourself if it is more important to save
livestock, machinery or feed. If a livestock building is on fire, animals
may already have been exposed to deadly heat, smoke and gases. It
may be safer and more realistic to save an adjacent building or
vehicles stored inside it.
CALLING THE FIRE DEPARTMENT
♦When calling the fire department, be prepared to give accurate and
complete information, including:
a) The exact location of your farm.
b) The extent and location of the fire.
c) The color of smoke coming from the burning structure(s). For
example: “A lot of black smoke is coming from the back of the
vehicle storage building.” This helps firefighters know what
materials are burning and what materials they need to fight the
fire.
d) Anything else the dispatcher requests. Stay on the line until the
dispatcher is through collecting all the necessary information.
♦Make sure the fire department has complete access to the blaze. Do
not let vehicles, livestock or people block the driveway or access to
buildings. This is a typical problem for firefighters. It can only lead to
greater damage and danger for all concerned.
♦Alert firefighters to potential hazards, including pesticide and
chemical storage areas and fuel tanks.

Livestock evacuation is very risky business. If fire or smoke is significant
within an animal building, the danger is generally too great to risk your
own life. Some considerations include:
♦Smoke, fire, burning insulation and toxic fumes. Some types of
insulation consume oxygen, give off poisonous smoke or “rain fire”
— that is, they may melt and drip as they burn. Fiberglass doesn't
burn. Be aware of the type of insulation in your barns and anticipate
how it might react in a blaze. Remember that smoke inhalation and
heat already may have harmed your animals to the extent they need to
be destroyed. Don't be the next victim.
♦Animals may refuse to leave the building. Cows and horses tend to
panic if they are frightened or forced to use a secondary exit. In some
cases, evacuated animals run back into burning buildings. Some
farmers have had luck leading a few panicked animals out by
throwing a gunnysack over their heads.
♦Don't become trapped. If you are able to evacuate animals, be sure
you are not leading them toward a dead-end, such as a gate that won't
open outward.
♦Containment may be the best answer. Oxygen fuels a fire. Sometimes
it is best to close the doors and wait for the fire department. Poultry
buildings, especially, are prone to flash fires because of their
construction and the large amounts of dust inside. If you open the
door, a burning poultry building is likely to burst into flames.
♦Smoldering hay. If hay is slowly smoldering in an upper level of a
barn or silo, call the fire department and, if possible, begin
evacuation. This is one instance where you may have enough time for
a quiet, orderly evacuation. DO NOT try to throw smoldering hay out
a window or door; exposure to oxygen fuels a blaze.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionClean-up After a Fire on the Farm
SAFETY CONCERNS AND WHERE TO GO FOR HELP
Hazards may still exist after
firefighters leave the scene of a
farm fire. Contaminated water
runoff and hazardous debris are
two of the most common
challenges for farmers during
clean-up efforts. With a little
foresight, you can avoid injury
to yourself, your family and your
livestock. You also can
streamline clean-up and
rebuilding.GENERAL GUIDELINES
♦Contaminated water runoff. When water used in firefighting mixes
with pesticides, fuels or other hazardous materials, the result is a
harmful runoff. It poses an immediate threat to groundwater
(including your wells), surface water, humans, animals and the
environment. By law, appropriate steps must be taken for containment
and clean-up.
a)Notify authorities. If hazardous materials have been released in the
course of firefighting, local and state authorities must be notified
and consulted for legal clean-up methods. Immediately contact
your Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), as well as
the Wisconsin Division of Emergency Government Spill Hotline
at (800) 943-0003.
b)Containment. In some cases, the fire department may help build
dikes or ditches to help contain water runoff until local emergency
response teams (hazardous materials specialists) arrive. In other
cases, emergency response teams will be called in to contain and
clean up the spill. If a spill is very small, officials may request
that you clean up the spill and dispose of waste at the next
Agricultural Clean Sweep event. In either case, try to direct
hazardous runoff away from porous (sand or gravel) soils to avoid
groundwater contamination.
c)Take safety precautions. Wear protective gear if you must enter a
contaminated area, such as a flooded pesticide storage room. Keep
livestock away from contaminated waters. Place warning signs on
contaminated areas and/or fence them off so that livestock,
children or others aren't accidentally exposed.
♦Building debris. Before beginning clean-up, take photographs or make
a videotape of damage. This will be helpful for insurance records
and/or income tax loss deductions. Also, have an insurance adjuster
inspect the premises. Based on insurance reimbursement and advice
from a building inspector or contractor, make decisions about whether
to rebuild or restore existing facilities (See the fact sheet, “Salvaging
Buildings After a Fire.”) Some clean-up suggestions:
a)Turn off the power to damaged buildings. Normally, power is shut
off during firefighting. Nevertheless, be absolutely sure you are
not dealing with live wires.
b)Wear protective gear and use caution. Falling debris, exposed
nails, glass, contaminants and sharp edges all pose hazards during
clean-up. Wear steel-toed boots, a hard hat, gloves and other
protective gear when necessary.

Your county agricultural agent, your
insurance agentc)Ask about local and state requirements for refuse disposal,
including any special requirements for livestock killed by fire.
d)Hire a professional contractor for demolition. A professional is
your best bet for safe, efficient clean-up.
♦Farm equipment and vehicles. Contact your insurance agent to
ascertain coverage and decide whether restoration is feasible. Even if
vehicles were not burned, heat can damage rubber, plastic, glass and
paint. If farm vehicles and field equipment have sustained only minor
to moderate smoke damage, specialty cleaning companies can provide
steam cleaning. Smoke cannot get into sealed engines, so
reconditioning usually is not a concern. For milking equipment,
contact the manufacturer about clean-up and testing services.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionSalvaging Food After a Fire
WHAT'S SAFE WHEN THE WORST IS OVER
Use extreme caution when trying
to save food after a fire. Food
and utensils damaged by heat,
smoke, chemicals or water may
not be safe to use. Food in cans
or jars may appear to be okay.
But if it has been close to the
heat of the fire, it may no longer
be edible. Heat from the fire can
activate food spoilage bacteria
or cause undesirable flavor
changes.
Toxic fumes can contaminate
food items as well. Items stored
in permeable packaging should
be thrown away. If you detect an
off-flavor or smell in refrigerated
foods, dispose of them as well.
Your family's health is not worth
the risk.WHEN IN DOUBT, THROW IT OUT
Be thorough in inspecting kitchen items for water, smoke, chemical and
heat damage. When in doubt, throw it out.
♦Throw out any of these items if they have come in contact with
waters or chemicals used in fire fighting:
a) Fresh produce, meat, poultry, fish and eggs.
b) Opened containers and packages.
c) Containers with peel-off tops, or cork-lined, waxed cardboard or
paraffin (waxed) seals.
d) All food in cardboard boxes, paper, foil, plastic, cellophane or
cloth.
e) Spices, seasonings and extracts, flour, sugar and other staples in
canisters.
♦Throw away any items that were charred or near the fire. Heat
damage may not be apparent on the outside of canned goods, but
extreme heat can harm the contents. Throw them away.
♦Throw away any raw foods stored outside the refrigerator like
potatoes or fruit, which could be contaminated by fumes or chemicals.
♦Disinfect cans that have no heat damage and are free from dents and
rust. Mark contents with an indelible pen, them remove the label.
Clean with detergent and scrub brush. Immerse for 10 minutes in a
warm solution of chlorine bleach and water — 2 tablespoons of
bleach per gallon of water.
REFRIGERATION AND FREEZER CONCERNS
Refrigerator and freezer seals may not be air-tight. If food has an off-smell
or flavor when it is prepared, throw it out.
If the electricity is out to the refrigerator or freezer, follow these
guidelines:
♦Discard refrigerated meats, seafood, milk, soft cheese, eggs, prepared
foods and cookie doughs if they have been kept above 40 degrees F.
for over two hours. Also discard thawed items that have warmed
above 40 degrees F., with the exception of breads and plain cakes.
♦Discard any refrigerated items that turn moldy or have an unusual
odor or appearance.

SAFETY GUIDELINES AFTER A DISASTER
During a disaster such as a
flood, tornado or fire, kitchen
items easily can become
contaminated. Floodwaters may
contain silt, raw sewage, oil or
chemical wastes, while fires may
leave residues from toxic fumes
or fire-fighting chemicals. Before
using any item that has come in
contact with these substances,
follow the guidelines at right.

Take apart any item that can be cleaned in pieces. If possible, remove
handles from pots. If you have a dishwasher and the hot water temperature
is at least 140 degrees F., use a long wash cycle and heated drying cycle to
clean and disinfect dishwasher-safe items. Regarding other items, or all
items if you don't have a dishwasher, follow these steps:
♦Wash all items in a a strong detergent solution. Use a brush to
remove dirt. Rinse in hot water.
♦Immerse glass, porcelain, china, plastic dinnerware and enamelware
for 10 minutes in a disinfecting solution of 2 tablespoons of chlorine
bleach per gallon of hot water.
♦Disinfect silverware, metal utensils, and pots and pans by boiling in
water for 10 minutes. Chlorine bleach should not be used in this case
because it reacts with many metals and causes them to darken.
♦Air-dry dishes. Do not use a towel.
♦Discard and replace soft, porous plastic or wood items saturated by
floodwater, since they cannot be sanitized. These include baby bottles,
nipples and pacifiers.
♦If cupboards and counters come in contact with floodwater, clean and
rinse them with a chlorine bleach solution before storing dishes.
Likewise, clean and disinfect surfaces affected by smoke, toxic fumes
or firefighting chemicals.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative Extension FIRE-HOME/FARMRECOVERYSalvaging Feed After a Fire
OPTIONS AFTER SMOKE, WATER OR FIRE DAMAGE
The best rule for fire-damaged
feed may be, “Assume the worst
until proven otherwise.” Damage
to feed may come from heat,
water, chemicals, smoke or the
fire itself. In some cases, you
may have a total loss; in other
cases, you may be able to
salvage all or part of your feed.
But for the safety of your
animals, either dispose of or test
any suspicious feed. If you feed
contaminated, moldy or
otherwise damaged feed, you
risk lowered production, illness
or death in your animals. At the
least, animals may refuse to eat
feed that has been charred or
has an odor.
Additional resources:
Your county agricultural agent, your
veterinarian, forage testing laboratories
Related publications:
“Extinguishing Silo Fires,” (NRAES-18),
Northeast Regional Agricultural
Engineering Service.SILAGE
♦Damaged silage must be unloaded because:
a) Overheated silage has lost its nutritional value.
b) The top layers of wet silage may spoil or be unacceptable to
animals.
c) Any missed hot spots may reignite.
♦Heat damage and fire damage. Silage that has been heated above 150
degrees F. loses much of its nutritional value. Charred silage also will
have little feed value; cows may not eat it, depending on taste or
aroma. In some instances, cows actually eat more heat-damaged silage
to try to compensate for the lost nutritional value. To determine
quality of overheated silage, send it to a feed testing laboratory.
Silage below the fire level will not be damaged and will not lose any
nutritional value.
♦Water damage. Silage saturated with water may mold and spoil
because much of the preserving acid produced during fermentation
has leached out or been diluted. The nutritional value of the saturated
silage is reduced and the cows may refuse to eat it. Consider
spreading it on land as a fertilizer.
GRAIN AND HAY
♦Debris.Be aware that metal, lead paint, nails from the roof or other
debris may have fallen into the feed during firefighting. Disposing of
grain may be your best option if debris has compromised the feed.
♦Darkened or burned feed. These have been oxidized and, therefore,
nutritional value has been reduced. Animals most likely won't eat
these feeds. Dispose of them or spread them on fields as fertilizer.
♦Wet feeds. It may be difficult or impossible to dry wet grain or hay
naturally. If these feeds are readily available and clean (no chance of
chemical contamination or fire-fighting debris), feed them to
livestock. Recognize that wet feeds may have only a few days of
“shelf life” before spoilage occurs. Otherwise, spread them on fields
as fertilizer or dispose of them.
♦Baled hay. Small quantities may be dried naturally if broken apart.
Larger quantities are generally a loss because of the difficulty of
drying. Hay quickly spoils when wet—and moldy hay may be
dangerously toxic to animals. If possible, spread hay on fields as a
fertilizer or dispose of it.

ASSESSING DAMAGE AND OPTIONS FOR REBUILDING
Before trying to salvage a
structure after a fire, assess the
true worth of what remains after
fire, heat, smoke and water
damage. The true worth will be
higher if the structure can be
effectively used as part of a
reconstructed facility.
An engineer or experienced
contractor can help you assess
true worth. These experts can
also help you consider options
for reconstruction or new
construction. Insurance
coverage and other assets will
probably be the final factor in
your decision-making.INSPECT EXISTING MATERIALS
♦Fiberglass and blown-in insulation. If insulation has gotten wet, it
will have to be removed and replaced with dry materials. If wall
surfaces must be replaced in the process, consider upgrading wiring
and plumbing at this time.
♦Steel.When exposed to intense heat, steel loses its strength and any
surface-applied corrosion protection. Steel beams cannot be relied
upon to support loads for which they were originally designed.
Replace these members if exposed to extreme heat to assure structural
integrity of the building.
♦Metal roofing and siding. Both rely on protective layers of
galvanizing and/or paint to protect corrosion. Plan to replace these
materials if exposed to heat, even if they were not in direct contact
with flames.
♦Wood.Light charring of wood will not significantly affect its strength.
Replace wooden supports which have been deeply burned.
♦Metal truss plates. Many roof trusses are fabricated with metal truss
plates. The metal truss plates may lose more strength in a fire than
the adjoining wood supports. Use a reliable contractor or engineer to
determine the extent of damage at these critical joints.
♦Concrete and mortar. These materials will flake off and/or turn to
powder when exposed to heat. The thickness of the damaged concrete
will be determined by the intensity and duration of heat exposure. Tap
concrete with a hammer to test its integrity. A dull thud implies heat
damage. A ringing sound means the concrete may be in reasonable
condition.
SALVAGING EXISTING STRUCTURES
Once the value of the remaining structure is established, assess how the
remnants can be rebuilt to meet your current and future needs. This is a
good opportunity to consider updating or upgrading of facilities. For
example:
♦Livestock buildings. Consider livestock resting, water and feeding
space needs; update ventilation, preferably using natural ventilation;
install moisture-proof wiring and an equipotential plane to protect
against stray voltage; install freeze-protected water systems; consider
animal traffic and manure handling.

and emptying and lower cost of construction and operation; size new
silos according to daily feeding needs.
♦Storage sheds. Consider access doors; consider a shop; use proper
wiring design and installation; consider size of items to be stored;
consider separate pesticide storage.
BUILDING NEW STRUCTURES
If the remnants cannot be economically reworked to satisfy your needs,
consider building a totally new structure. Be especially critical of the
remnants when making this assessment. Consider:
♦Location. Locate animal structures so odors blow away from the
house and neighbors' houses; locate to take advantage of wind for
natural ventilation in livestock buildings; consider space needs for
future structures.
♦Drainage. Locate on high ground to shed water from the site and to
avoid flooding from upland areas.
♦Traffic patterns. Consider how equipment, animals, feed, grain and
manure will be routed around the farm.
♦Current size of structure and future expansion needs. Develop a
farmstead drawing of how your farmstead will look in 10 to 20 years.
♦Expense. Before deciding on a final option, consider the economics of
several options. Make your decisions based on lower annual cost
options — not the lowest initial investment; consider your long-term
needs when making a short-term decision.
FIRE CONTROL MEASURES
Be sure all new construction features fire-retardant material and design
concepts that result in fire safety. Early warning devices such as smoke
detectors and heat detectors should be part of new designs, as well as
ventilation systems that shut down during a fire.

WHAT TO DO BEFORE AND AFTER A DISASTER
With the exception of flooding
damage, most losses due to
natural disasters are covered by
homeowner's insurance. Still,
few policies cover the cost of all
damages. Study your policy and
talk with your agent about
additional coverage before
disaster strikes. Find out
whether claims are paid on the
basis of replacement cost or
current market value, and
whether reimbursement covers
total replacement cost or a given
percentage of the replacement
cost.
Contact your insurance agent
immediately after a disaster.
Planning ahead and having the
agent's phone number and your
policy number will expedite the
process. It also helps to have a
written and photo or video
inventory of personal property.
Finally, check with your local
emergency government office
about disaster rehabilitation
assistance. Some disaster
assistance may be available for
expenses not covered by your
insurance policy. (See the fact
sheet, “Disaster Rehabilitation
Assistance.”)TYPES OF INSURANCE
Many types of insurance may come into play during disaster recovery. If
injuries or loss of life occurred, these will extend to health insurance,
disability and life insurance. Clean-up and repair of your home and other
property involve the following insurance types:
♦Homeowner's and renter's insurance. In general, property insurance
will include some coverage for “fire or lightning damage,” and/or
“wind and hail damage,” which includes some of the typical damage
from tornadoes and hurricanes.
Most policies cover damage from water or water blowing in only if
an opening to the structure sustains damage. Some may cover
basement flooding caused by sewer backup or sump pump failure.
Damage from surface water — as in floor or “rising water” damage
— is not covered in the usual private policy. You must purchase
special flood insurance for this coverage (see next bulleted item).
A homeowner's policy will include several other elements as well,
such as liability insurance for injuries or damages caused by you, a
member of your family or a pet.
♦Flood Insurance. Unless you specifically purchase flood insurance,
your homeowner's policy does not insure you against losses caused by
flooding. Most communities in Wisconsin participate in the National
Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), under which you can buy
federally-subsidized flood insurance at a reasonable cost. If your
community participates, any owner or occupant of insurable property
may buy a policy from a licensed insurance agent or broker, or
directly from the NFIP. Buildings and their contents can be insured
against flood loss; all direct losses by flood are covered.
Your insurance agent, zoning administrator or other local official can
tell you if your community participates in the NFIP. For routine
policy rating or customer service inquiries, call the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, which administers the program, at
(800) 638-6620.
♦Automobile insurance. Study your policy to determine the extent of
your current coverage. Comprehensive insurance covers damage to
your car from various natural disasters. Coverage includes flood, fire,
smoke, wind, hail, glass breakage, vandalism, theft and collision with
animals. Auto liability insurance is protection against the cost of
defending yourself if you are sued for injury or damage caused by
your car.

more informationSETTLING YOUR CLAIM
Do not settle your claim until:
♦A thorough inspection of the
property has been completed by
an insurance adjuster and repair
contractor.
♦Estimates for all damages have
been prepared and you fully
understand them. You, your
insurance adjuster and
contractor should agree on
needed repairs and estimates.
♦Advance insurance payments
have been calculated,
deductibles have been applied
and you know the total amount
of your settlement.
♦You have identified damaged
items you are keeping and agree
with salvage deductions.
♦You have identified any items
that won't be repaired, but for
which you will be paid an
“appearance loss” (for example,
hail-damaged siding).
♦You and your contractor
understand any time limits for
repairs, as required by the
insurance company. (Extensions
usually can be granted with
advance notice.)

AgencyMAKING AN INSURANCE CLAIM
♦Contact your insurance agent and report the damage. Give your
name, address, policy number, and the date and time of loss. The
sooner you talk to an agent, the sooner your claim will be filed and
an adjuster will look at your damage. Ask when the adjuster will visit.
♦Protect your property from further damage or theft. Patch roofs
temporarily. Cover broken windows with boards or plastic. If
household furnishings are exposed to the weather, move them to a
safe location for storage. Take pictures of the damage beforehand if
possible.
♦Keep accurate records:
a) A list of all cleaning and repair bills, including materials, cost of
rental equipment and depreciation of purchase equipment.
b) A list of all disaster-related living expenses, including motel and
restaurant bills, home rental and car rental.
c) A list of all actual losses, including furniture, appliances, clothing,
paintings, artifacts, food and equipment, regardless of your intent
to replace the objects. Try to document the value of each object
lost. Written and videotaped household inventories, bills of sale,
canceled checks, charge account records and insurance evaluations
are good evidence. If you do not have such records, estimate the
value and give purchase place and date of purchase.
d) Photographs of damaged property. Pictures also can be used as
evidence for tax deductions.
♦Contact a reputable and well-established firm or individual to have
your damage repaired. Sometimes undependable workers enter a
damaged area, make cheap repairs and leave before residents discover
that repairs are inadequate. Get recommendations and written
contracts for the work.
♦Don't be in a hurry to settle your claim. Often, people are so anxious
to have their home restored after a disaster, they sign off on a
settlement before damages are fully discovered or repair costs fully
understood. (See sidebar at left.)

GRANTS, LOANS AND HOW TO APPLY
A variety of disaster assistance
is available to homeowners,
farmers and businesses with
property damage. Lending
agencies make loans for home
repair, improvement, land
equipment and livestock. Federal
and state assistance may be
available if your community is
declared a disaster area by your
governor, a federal agency
director or the president. Local
government and media will keep
you informed about disaster
declarations and where to get
information about any programs.
If your area is declared a major
disaster area, one or more
Disaster Application Centers
(DACs) may open to provide
information and take
applications for assistance. They
usually are located in a school
or other public building.
While low-interest loans and
cost-share programs can be very
attractive, be sure you carefully
analyze the impact of additional
borrowing on your household,
farm or business before you
undertake any new obligations.HOME AND PERSONAL PROPERTY
♦During times of disaster, the Small Business Administration (SBA)
offers medium- and long-term loans for rehabilitation of homes and
personal property. Interest rates are relatively low. Two loan types:
a)Small Business Administration (SBA) Personal Property Loans:
For the repair and replacement of personal items such as clothing,
furniture and automobiles.
b)SBA Real Property Loans: To repair or restore a primary home to
its pre-disaster condition. If you are required by local government
to make structural improvements or relocate, these costs may be
included in a loan.
♦Federal Emergency Management Agency assistance. If you are denied
an SBA loan, you may be eligible for a FEMA grant, which is
administered by the state. Your community may also apply for
funding under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, which covers
acquisition and relocation expenses for homeowners in flood-prone
areas, as well as flood-proofing. See your local or state emergency
government office about participation and any restrictions.
♦Private lenders. You may be eligible for loans from your local bank
or credit union.
♦Historical societies. Check with your local historical society about
loan or grant programs available for architecturally significant
properties.
BUSINESS
♦Small Business Association (SBA) Physical Disaster Business Loans:
To repair and/or flood-proof buildings and remove debris for small
businesses.
♦SBA Economic Disaster Business Loans: To permit small businesses
to meet the financial obligations they would have made, had the
disaster not occurred.
♦HUD Community Development Block Grants: May cover relocation or
flood-proofing of business properties as part of a larger community
development plan. Grants are funded through the federal Housing and
Urban Development agency.

Insurance, volunteer
organizations and businesses
are three other important
sources of assistance for
disaster survivors. If you are
fully insured, you may only
have to pay the deductible and
your insurance policy will pay
for professional cleaning and
reconstruction. The same is
true for flood Insurance, which
may be purchased in most
Wisconsin communities
through the National Flood
Insurance Program. Meet with
local emergency government
officials about current options
and funding sources related to
flood-proofing or relocation.
Private volunteer organizations,
such as the American Red
Cross, the Salvation Army and
church groups, usually are on
the scene during or after a
disaster. These groups help
with clothing, groceries,
shelter, medical aid, counseling
and, in some cases, clean-up
and rebuilding supplies.
Services often are supplied free
of charge.
Your local TV, radio and
newspapers usually publicize
ways that businesses are
contributing to the recovery
process. Some businesses may
offer reduced prices, but you
should be wary of “flood sales”
of flood-damaged items.

STRATEGIES FOR FAMILIES AFTER A DISASTER
Disasters can create serious
financial crises for families.
Insurance may not cover as
much as anticipated. Homes and
jobs may be lost. Family
members may be out of work
due to injuries. In an ideal world,
families have adequate cash
reserves or credit to draw on for
disasters. But reality is often far
from ideal.
Making decisions about repairs
and purchases, and developing
resources to maintain your home
can be difficult. However, some
basic financial tools and
household saving strategies can
help you survive an emergency.
In some cases, you may be able
to make ends meet by making
changes in the way money is
handled every day.FINANCIAL TOOLS
♦Cut back on current spending as much as possible.
♦Use cash reserves if you have them. When the emergency passes,
rebuild your reserves.
♦Use unsecured credit, such as a credit card, but use it wisely.
Whenever possible, pay your balance in full to avoid finance charges.
If you know that you will need several months to repay, consider
taking out a loan rather than charging things on a credit card. Finance
charges are likely to be lower for the loan than for the credit card. If
you think you will be late making payments or you if have missed
payments, contact your creditors immediately to make special
arrangements.
♦Borrow against your assets. If your home survived the disaster, you
may be able to borrow against a portion of the equity through
refinancing, a second mortgage or a home equity line of credit. Or
you may be able to borrow against your equity in an employee
pension plan or whole life insurance policy.
♦Liquidate assets. You may want to consider selling major assets to
generate cash. This will require making some difficult decisions about
your priorities.
♦Discuss options for reducing interest charges on outstanding loans
with your creditors.
LOOK FOR WAYS TO SAVE
♦Look at each monthly bill to see if you can make reductions and still
keep the item or service. Telephone bills are a good place to start,
especially if you have additional services that could be dropped
temporarily, such as a second line or call waiting. Try lowering long
distance charges by making fewer calls, shorter calls or calling when
rates are lowest.
♦Examine bills for cable TV, electricity, water and car maintenance for
places to save. Utilities, such as the electric company, will help you
with ideas to reduce costs, including use of balanced billing plans to
even out expenses.
♦Talk to insurance agents about ways to reduce costs. In some cases,
deductibles can be raised, coverage lowered, life insurance converted
to lower cost plans, or life insurance on children discontinued.

“Making Ends Meet: Our Spending
Plan,” (B7760313).♦Consider bartering. If you need repairs done in your home, consider
exchanging your skills for the repair service you need. Some
communities have bartering networks and groups, but you may be
able to barter with a relative, neighbor or friend. Some examples are
exchanging wallpapering for lawn mowing, fixing leaks for car repair,
resume preparation for appliance repair.
LOOK FOR WAYS TO DO WITHOUT
♦What things could you do without for a few months? Consider such
overlooked expenses as newspaper or magazine subscriptions, hair
care and/or beauty treatments, clothing, classes or lessons, sports
leagues, nights out, vending machine snacks or buying meals at work.
♦Learn nice ways to say no. It may be to a salesperson on the phone, a
friend asking to do something that costs more than you care to pay, or
a child saying, “Everybody has one.” Some easy ways of saying no
are:
a) “That's something we've decided not to buy right now.”
b) “That's a great price, (product, offer, idea) but I'm afraid I have to
pass for now.”
c) “Let me think about it.”
To children, suggest, “That's something you can buy with your allowance,”
or “Let's think of some ways for you to earn or save the money to buy it.”
♦Shop less often and with a written list. Time spent in stores
encourages spending money, especially when shopping trips are not
essential. Take only as much cash as you can reasonably spend. Don't
carry credit cards or ATM cards.
♦Look for alternatives to making new major purchases. Borrow an
appliance from a family member or friend. Or buy an inexpensive
used model through the newspaper, a friend or a garage sale.
ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF INCOME
If physical damage to your home was minor, you might consider
temporary room rental as an additional source of income. Be sure your
local regulations and zoning laws permit room rental. Garage sales may be
a good way to bring in extra cash if you have undamaged items that you
no longer need. Consider a cooperative garage sale with family, friends or
neighbors.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionRestructuring Debt After a Disaster
ESTABLISHING PRIORITIES AND ADJUSTING DEBT
You are obligated to pay all of
your creditors, even after a
disaster has shaken your
financial status. However, debt
adjustments can ease a difficult
financial period by reducing the
amount paid to creditors, or
extending the time period for
payments.
Before contacting creditors, take
a hard look at your finances and
evaluate how much and when
you can pay. Consider:
♦Your monthly income
♦Essential monthly living
expenses
♦Number of creditors and total
amount owed
♦How long your present
financial circumstances will last
♦Assets (savings, items that
could be sold) that could help
pay off loans
♦High-priority debts
♦Debts that could be satisfied
by voluntarily surrendering, or
giving back, an itemDECIDING WHICH DEBTS TO PAY FIRST
If you can't pay all your bills, you must decide how much to pay to which
creditors. One way is to divide available money and pay every creditor a
share of what you owe. This is probably the fairest way, but it doesn't
always work because each creditor must agree to reduce the amount they
receive and extend the payment period.
Another creditor payment strategy involves setting priorities. Ask yourself
these questions:
♦What will affect my family's health and security the most? Usually the
house, utilities, food, transportation and medical insurance take
priority. Don't be tempted to let medical insurance slide when money
is tight. If anyone in your family becomes ill, uninsured medical costs
could be devastating. Pay high-priority bills or contact creditors at
once to work out smaller payments.
♦What will we lose if the bills aren't paid? You can lose your
purchases if the creditor holds the title of the property as security for
the loan: a home mortgage or car loan, for example. Sometimes
furniture and large appliance loans are secured loans. If you aren't
sure which loans are secured, check the credit contract. Unsecured
debts may have to take lower priority, although you are obligated to
pay them too.
♦How much do we still owe on the loan? Determine how much you
have paid on each loan and how much you owe. If you have only one
or two payments to make on a loan, it's probably a good idea to finish
paying it. Getting out from under some of your debts can reduce the
pressure you feel. You may be able to return newer items or sell them
to pay off the debt. If you choose to voluntarily surrender an item,
you'll still be required to pay the difference between its market value
and the amount remaining on the loan.
♦What interest rate are we paying? Credit card firms charging 1.5%
interest per month would receive 18% interest per year on the unpaid
balances. If you have a loan with a lower interest rate, you may
decide to pay off a higher interest credit card balance first, to reduce
the amount of finance charges you are paying. Until your financial
situation improves, watch credit card purchases carefully. Consider
putting cards away in a safe place so you are not tempted to use
them.

more informationMAKING IT WORK
Remember — no matter how bad
your situation may be, don't
ignore your bills and creditors.
Prompt action is very important;
let your creditors know you are
having trouble before you miss
payments and the situation
becomes worse.
♦Once you have worked out a
repayment plan, follow through
with it and make the payments
you promised to make. If you fall
behind on your new
commitments, creditors will be
less understanding. If you fail to
make the payments, creditors
may hire a collection agency to
make you pay.
♦Openly discuss spending
decisions with all family
members. This will help
everyone realize that changes
and sacrifices must be made for
your family's plan to be
successful.

“Making Ends Meet: Our Spending
Plan,” (B7760313).♦Is consolidation a good idea? Personal finance companies want you
to think so, but generally a consolidation loan charges a higher
interest rate, often 20% or more. And refinancing to smaller monthly
payments will extend the number of payments you must make, adding
to the total cost. If you are facing a temporary financial crisis because
of disaster, the ease of a single payment may be worth the higher
interest rate if you can pay back the loan early with no penalty.
♦What about our credit record? Nonpayment of debts is recorded on
your credit record and can damage your ability to get credit in the
future. That's why you should contact all of your creditors
immediately if you cannot pay your bills.
YOUR REPAYMENT PLAN
Once you have calculated how much money your family has for monthly
living expenses and for paying off debts:
♦Decide how much you can pay to each creditor, based on priorities
you determined while answering the previous questions.
♦Work out a repayment plan that shows how much you plan to pay
each creditor. Put this plan in writing.
♦Contact each of your creditors to explain your family situation. You
will need to tell them how much you are able to pay and when you
will be able to pay it. (See the fact sheet, “Communicating With
Creditors,” in this series.)
♦Some businesses, such as utility companies, have counselors to help
you budget even payments during the year. They also can tell you if
you qualify for fuel assistance or any available programs.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionCommunicating With Creditors
WHEN YOU FACE MISSING PAYMENTS AFTER A DISASTER
After a natural disaster, you may
face temporary loss of income
and steep bills for clean-up and
repair not covered by insurance.
If you realize you can't pay all
your bills, it is important to face
your debts and know how to talk
to creditors.
Your past experiences with
creditors are important. If you
have consistently paid bills
when due, your creditors will be
more cooperative than if you
were late or didn't make regular
payments. Creditors want to
keep your business, but as
businesses they also need to be
paid.
Contact your creditors
immediately; don't wait for them
to contact you. Explain your
current situation. Tell them your
family income is reduced and
you are not able to keep up with
your payments. Frankly discuss
your future income prospects so
you and your creditors can
figure out solutions to the
problem. Most creditors would
prefer to receive smaller
payments on a regular basis
than to begin expensive
collection procedures.WHERE TO BEGIN
Before you and your creditors agree on a reduced payment or some other
solution, determine how much money you have to pay off your debts.
Figure out how much income you can count on each month and how much
you need to pay for your essential monthly living expenses.
Once you have gathered this information, contact each creditor explaining
your family's situation and work out a solution. Be prepared to explain:
♦The reason you cannot pay.
♦Your current income and prospects for future income.
♦Other obligations.
♦Your plans to bring this debt up-to-date and keep it current, including
the amount you will be able to pay each month.
Visit local creditors in person. Contact out-of-town creditors by phone or
letter. If you phone, write down the name and title of the person to whom
you talked. Follow the conversation with a letter summarizing the
agreement between you and the creditor. Keep copies of your
correspondence as well as any replies.
As you negotiate with each of your creditors, don't agree to any loan
simply to get off the hook. Be sure you will be able to follow through on
the agreement. Establish a payment rate that is realistic and acceptable to
both you and the creditor.
RENEGOTIATION OPTIONS
Here are some alternatives to consider when negotiating with your
creditors:
♦Reducing the monthly payment
♦Refinancing the loan
♦Consolidating your loans
♦Deferring a payment for a short time if you expect your income will
increase soon
♦Reducing or dropping late charges
♦Paying only interest on the loan until you can resume making monthly
payments
University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative Extension COMMUNITY /FAMILYISSUES-FAMILYFINANCES
more informationWHEN THEY CALL…
If you receive a call from a
creditor or a collection agency:
♦Ask the name of the caller. Get
the name of the creditor and the
name, address and telephone
number of the collection agency.
Get the exact amount of the
account that is claimed to be
due. Write down the date and
time of each call.
♦Don't get angry. Remain calm
in order to obtain the
information noted above.
♦Dispute debts in writing. If you
believe you do not owe the
amount claimed or disagree in
other ways, make your reasons
known promptly in writing to
both the creditor and the
collection agency. Request a
written statement of your
account.

♦Selling the item and using the cash to satisfy, or partially satisfy, the
debt (you are still responsible for any remaining balance)
Not all creditors will be willing to accept alternatives. However, they will
be more likely to work with your family if you contact them before they
contact you. If you fail to follow the plan that you and your creditor
agreed upon, you may hurt your chances of getting future credit. Tell your
creditors about anticipated changes that may affect your payment
agreement.
IF YOU DON'T PAY YOUR BILLS
If you miss a payment, you will face increasing pressure to pay. First you
will receive a letter reminding you that you missed a payment and asking
you to pay promptly. After that, you may receive a more direct letter
demanding payment, or you may get a phone call.
If the bills are still not paid, they will probably be turned over to an
independent collection agency.
CREDITOR'S OPTIONS
Creditors can take several kinds of legal action against you if you fail to
make payments:
♦Acceleration. The entire debt is payable at once if you miss a
payment. The courts can force you to pay by seizing your property
and selling it.
♦Repossession. The creditor can seize the item you bought or the
property you used as collateral. If the sale of the property brings less
than the amount you owe, you must pay the difference.
♦Wage garnishment. A court order requires your employer to withhold
part of your wages and pay your creditor.
♦Foreclosure. The lender may start proceedings to take possession of
your home/business and sell it to recover the remaining balance of the
loan. You are responsible for the legal fees of foreclosure and the
difference between the selling price of the property and the amount
owed on the loan.
All of these actions are very serious and could jeopardize your ability to
get credit in the future. To avoid such problems, work out solutions for
debt repayment early and stick with the plan unless it is renegotiated.

OPENING UP COMMUNICATION AFTER A DISASTER
No matter what damage a
disaster leaves in its wake,
the common denominator is
often a money crunch. While
money problems may seem
too painful to discuss, they
may only get worse if you
don't talk about them.
Overcoming financial
difficulties takes honest and
candid communication. It
also takes time and effort.
Coming together as a family

opportunity to figure out how
they can contribute. Even a

When families work on financial issues together, the result is often new
solutions and a new appreciation for the strengths and resources each member
has to offer. Here are a few guidelines:
♦Family members, including children old enough to understand, should be
involved in decisions. Family members will be more satisfied with
decisions if they have input.
♦Remember that disasters bring with them a range of emotions. Each of
you may be at different stages in dealing with losses and new hardships.
Try to be calm, patient and supportive of one another.
♦Set a specific time to have a family discussion. Choose a location where
you won't be interrupted.
♦Clearly identify the issue at hand. Don't drag other points into the
discussion that don't address the problem, concern or dissatisfaction.
♦Let each family member freely state his or her wants, needs and personal
feelings. Avoid judging or criticizing.
♦Be willing to negotiate for a realistic settlement of differences. In many
cases, family members must compromise. Making a contract or written
agreement may help avoid misunderstandings. Solutions also can be
accepted on a trial basis, and changed if the results aren't satisfactory.
ONE THING AT A TIME
As a family, focus on ways to tackle one problem area at a time. During one
gathering you might talk about ways the family can spend less money. At
another session, tackle methods for record keeping as a way to control
spending.
When discussing new purchases or services, ask:
♦Can we do without it?
♦Can we postpone it?
♦Can we substitute something less expensive?
♦Can we shop around for a better deal?
♦Can we make or do it ourselves?

GUIDELINES FOR PARENTS AFTER A DISASTER
Disaster-related financial stress
can take a toll on young
children, especially when
parents are busy with day-to-day
recovery and clean-up.
While children's complaints may
seem trivial in light of other
problems at home, they often
signal the need to talk about
why the family must cut
spending. Each family has to
decide how much to tell their
children about the family's
financial situation. If children
know how the family stands
financially, they can better
cooperate with the family
spending plan. They also can
better handle their own money.

Plan,” (B7760313).GET CHILDREN INVOLVED
Children can't help but be affected when the family cuts back on spending.
So it makes sense that they are included in discussions about changes that
will affect them.
♦Have family meetings to talk about money concerns.
a) Offer information that children can understand without
overwhelming them.
b) Encourage children to discuss their personal feelings and
suggestions for handling the crisis.
c) Avoid judging and criticizing.
♦Explain financial issues in terms your children can understand. For
example, you can tell your daughter that you aren't spending $100 to
buy a new video game system because that same $100 is needed for
family groceries. Help children learn they can't buy everything they
want, and that there is a difference between what they want and what
they need.
♦Find ways that your children can help the family cut expenses.
Children can learn to comparison shop if parents point out unit prices,
store brands and generic brands. At home, they can help compare
prices in advertising flyers from different stores. Even young children
can learn to turn off lights and appliances to save on energy costs.
Older children can choose “free” activities with their friends, like
going for a bike ride or to a park or library, rather than going places
where money is needed, like a shopping center, video arcade or roller
skating rink.
♦Refer to your family as a team. Agree that together you can get
through these tough financial times.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative Extension COMMUNITY /FAMILYISSUES-FAMILYFINANCESIncome Tax Deductions For Property Loss
STEPS TO TAKE AFTER A DISASTER
Property losses from natural
disaster are tax deductible. Such
deductions, which are allowed
for partial or total loss of
personal or business property,
could greatly reduce the amount
of federal income taxes owed for
the year the disaster occurred.RECORDS
If you claim a theft or casualty loss resulting from a disaster you may be
asked to show:
♦The kind of disaster and when it occurred;
♦That the damage was a direct result of the disaster;
♦That you were the owner of the property;
♦Your income tax basis in the property. In general, this is the original
cost of the property plus the cost of any improvements before the
loss, minus depreciation claimed for income tax purposes (for
business and rental property);
♦Fair market value before and after the disaster;
♦Any insurance benefits or other compensation received including free
repairs, restoration and clean-up from any disaster relief agencies.
Before-and-after photographs, receipts, canceled checks, deeds, purchase
contracts and professional appraisals are good supporting evidence for
casualty claims.
APPRAISAL
If either personal or business property has been damaged extensively, you
should have the property appraised as soon as possible following the
disaster. A professional estimate of value will serve as evidence for
casualty loss claims. The fee charged is also a deductible item.
ITEMIZING TAX DEDUCTIONS
If you itemize your tax deductions, you may deduct casualty losses from
fire, storm, theft or property destroyed by some sudden external force.
However, you must reduce the deduction by any reimbursements or
payments received to rebuild or restore property.
Specifically, homeowners can claim a casualty loss deduction for the
difference between the fair market value of their property before the
disaster and after, subtracting insurance proceeds (or other reimbursements
they receive to rebuild or restore a home), 10 percent of adjusted gross
income and $100 per disaster event. To document the before- and
after-market value of your home, use the most recent assessed value from
property taxes for the before-disaster market value and a current appraisal
for the after-disaster market value.

American Red Cross, the Federal
Emergency Management Agency
Related publications:
IRS Tax Form 4684 and instruction
sheetIf renters make repairs on the property or offer repayment for part of the
loss, that too is considered reimbursement and must be subtracted to
determine the amount of casualty loss that can be claimed. Grants or other
gifts that are specifically designed to repair or replace property must be
deducted as well. Homeowners who haven't received a reimbursement, but
expect to, will be required to make an estimate of the reimbursement and
subtract it. Those who find they overestimated their reimbursements can
amend their casualty loss claim in another tax year.
HOW TO FIGURE DEDUCTIONS
The rules for figuring deductions on business or non-business property
losses are the same.
Subtract the reduced market value after the disaster from the fair market
value before the disaster. For example, on personal property:
Fair market value before $75,000
Fair market value after 30,000
Reduction in value 45,000
(Line 1 minus Line 2)
Income tax basis 55,000
(the original cost of property,
$40,000, plus the cost of any
pre-disaster improvements, $15,000)
Casualty loss $45,000
(lesser of Line 3 or 4)
The casualty loss deduction is the lesser of the reduction in value or the
income tax basis. In the above example, the casualty loss deduction would
be $45,000.
If a business or income-producing property is completely destroyed by a
casualty, special rules apply. In such cases, the loss is the income tax basis
reduced by any salvage value, insurance or other compensation. If
insurance is more than the income tax basis, a taxable gain results.
For more details, contact your local tax representative for advice on
figuring these tax loss deductions. To file for casualty loss, use IRS Tax
Form 4684 and request an instruction sheet.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionEmotional Recovery After a Disaster
HOW FAMILIES AND NEIGHBORS CAN HELP ONE ANOTHER COPE
Disasters bring with them an
incredible range of emotions,
from disbelief and anger to a
euphoric spirit of teamwork.
Temporary homelessness,
damaged personal items, lost
crops and an uncertain future
weigh heavily on survivors.
Unfortunately, the need to talk
about one's losses, fears and
anxieties may be forgotten in the
wake of clean-up efforts.
Mental health professionals have
identified a number of
post-disaster phases that
survivors may experience, as
well as guidelines for managing
disaster-related stress. The most
common coping tools are our
abilities to listen, talk and
actively support one another
during this time.PHASES OF DISASTER
It is important to recognize the emotional phases we may experience after
disaster. There is often overlap between phases.
♦Historic phase. This period usually occurs at the time of impact and
in the period immediately after. Emotions are strong and direct.
People find themselves being called upon and responding to demands
for heroic action to save their own and others' lives and property.
Altruism is prominent, and people expend major energy in helping
others survive and recover. The most important resources during this
phase are family groups, neighbors and emergency teams of various
sorts.
♦Honeymoon phase. This period generally extends from one week to
six months after the disaster. For survivors, even with the loss of
loved ones and possessions, there is a strong sense of having shared
with others a dangerous, catastrophic experience and having lived
through it. Supported and often encouraged by the influx of official
and governmental staff who promise many kinds of help, the victims
begin clean-up. There is anticipation that more help soon will be
available. Pre-existing community groups and emergency community
groups are especially important resources during this period.
♦Disillusionment phase. This phase generally lasts from about two
months to one or even two or more years. Strong feelings of
disappointment, anger, resentment and bitterness may appear if
failures occur and the promises of aid are not fulfilled. Outside
agencies may need to leave, and some of the local community groups
may weaken. Also contributing to this stage may be the gradual loss
of the feeling of “shared community” as victims concentrate on
rebuilding their own lives and solving their individual problems.
♦Reconstruction phase. The survivors come to realize they will need to
solve the problems of rebuilding their own homes, businesses, farms
and lives largely by themselves and gradually assume responsibility
for the tasks. This phase generally lasts for several years after the
disaster. The appearance of new buildings replacing old ones, the
beginnings of new construction and the development of new programs
and plans all serve to reaffirm residents' belief in their community and
their own capabilities. If these signs of progress are delayed, however,
the emotional problems that appear may be serious and intense.
Community groups with a longer-term investment in the community
and its people become key players during this phase.

♦Let people give you a hand. Take advantage of people who are
willing and able to help. Volunteers may be available for
sand-bagging or clean-up of debris. Relief agencies may offer food
and cleaning supplies. The additional help can make a critical
difference between coping and suffering.
♦Take care of your physical and emotional needs.
a) See that you and your family members eat a balanced diet to fuel
your energy.
b) Try to get enough sleep. Fatigue slows you down during an
emergency and makes you prone to accidents and injury.
c) Talk with others about your feelings and listen to theirs. Together,
look for positives in the situation.
♦Be patient with one another. Realize that when we suffer losses, it is
natural to express disbelief, anger, sadness, anxiety and depression
afterwards. Emotions will rollercoaster and moods can change
suddenly. Spouses' viewpoints may vary considerably.
♦Don't overlook the feelings of children as you deal with the disaster.
They need to feel they can count on you for extra attention, love and
support. Reassure them, making sure they understand they are not
responsible for the problems you face (See fact sheet, “Helping Your
Child Cope With Disaster”).
♦Refocus on the big picture, instead of little details and the little
problems. Don't expect things to instantly restore themselves.
♦Remember that a support network is essential. In addition to family
members and friends, you may wish to speak with clergy members
and professional counselors. In some cases, you may need to refer a
family member or friend for help (See fact sheet, “Identifying Stress
in Family or Others”).
♦Show by words and actions that you care. A friendly arm around
troubled shoulders or a few words of support can help tremendously.
Offer specific types of help or ask how you can help. Don't be afraid
of saying or doing the wrong thing. And keep helping. Even small,
kind deeds will mean a lot to others.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionIdentifying Stress in Family and Others
WHEN OUTSIDE HELP IS NEEDED AFTER A DISASTER
A feeling of helplessness is
a normal reaction to a
disaster. Personal coping
methods like talking things
out, accepting comfort and
help from others, and
taking things one day at a
time help most people
through the rough times.
But when those methods
fail, outside help may be
needed. If you notice the
warning signs of severe
stress in a family member,
neighbor or a friend, there
are some things you can
do.SIGNS OF PROLONGED STRESS
When families or individuals are under stress for long periods of time they may
experience a number of signs and symptoms. Watch for the following effects in
people you see on a day-to-day basis.
♦Physical. Headaches, ulcers, backaches, eating irregularities, sleep
disturbances, frequent sickness, exhaustion.
♦Emotional. Sadness, depression, bitterness, anger, anxiety, loss of spirit,
loss of humor.
♦Behavioral. Irritability, backbiting, acting out, withdrawal,
passive-aggressiveness, alcoholism, violence.
♦Cognitive. Memory loss, lack of concentration, inability to make decisions.
♦Self-esteem. Comments such as, “I'm a failure,” “I blew it,” “Why can't
I...?”
CRIES FOR HELP
The greater the number of signs or symptoms, the greater your concern should
be. If someone is exhibiting the following signs of depression or suicide, it is
important they get linked up with help as soon as possible. All cries for help
should be taken seriously.
Signs of depression:
♦Appearance. Sad face, slow movements, lack of interest in appearance.
♦Unhappy feelings. Feeling sad, hopeless, discouraged, listless.
♦Negative thoughts. “I'm a failure.” “I'm no good,” “No one cares.”
♦Reduced activity. “Doing anything is just too much of an effort.”
♦Isolation. “I don't want anyone to see me,” “I feel so lonely.”
♦Guilt and low self-esteem. “It's all my fault,” “I should be punished.”
Signs of suicidal intent:
♦Anxiety or depression. Severe, intense feelings of anxiety or depression.
♦Withdrawal or isolation. Withdrawn, alone, lack of friends or supports.

♦Call the agency and ask to
speak to the intake worker (if
there is one). Identify yourself
and your relationship with the
person or family.
♦State what you think the
person's or family's needs are
(immediate protection from
suicidal acts, an appointment for
counseling.)
♦Provide the agency with
background information (name,
address and phone; age and
sex; nature of current problem
or crisis; any past history you
are aware of.)
♦Ask the agency what follow-up
action they will take. Find out
when they will act on the
referral, whom you may contact
later, cost of the service, etc.
Make sure the person or family
and the referral agency connect.
Make one or more follow-up
contacts with the agency if
necessary.

feeling.
♦Alcohol or drug abuse. There is often a link between alcoholism,
drugs and suicide.
♦Previous suicide attempts.
♦Cries for help: Making a will, giving possessions away, making
statements such as “I'm calling it quits.”
FARM FAMILIES
Even without disasters, recent years have been difficult for farm families.
Many are experiencing financial and emotional stress that is only
heightened by disasters such as flood or tornadoes. There are several signs
when a farm family may be in need of help. They include:
♦Changes in routine. The farmer or farm family stops attending church
or drops out of community groups.
♦Increase in illness. Farmers or family members may experience more
colds, flu, aches and pains.
♦Appearance of farmstead declines. The farm family no longer takes
pride in the way farm buildings and grounds appear.
♦Care of livestock declines. Cattle may not be cared for in the usual
way; they may lose condition, or show signs of abuse.
♦Increase in farm accidents. The risk of farm accidents increases
because of fatigue or loss of ability to concentrate.
♦Children show signs of stress. Farm children may act out, experience
academic declines or increased school absences; they also may show
signs of physical abuse or neglect.
HOW TO REFER A PERSON FOR HELP
If you see signs that the person or family needs help that you can't provide
(financial, legal or personal counseling), try to assess what agency or
community resource would be most appropriate. Then discuss the referral
with the person or family. You might say, “It sounds/looks like you are
feeling____. I think ____ could help you deal with your situation.”
Explore the individual or family's willingness to initiate contact with the
community resource. Ask, “How do you feel about seeking help from this
person/agency?” If they are unwilling to take the initiative or there is some
danger if action is not taken, you should call an agency for assistance. (See
sidebar, above left.)

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionHelping Your Child Cope With Disaster
WAYS TO HELP CHILDREN DEAL WITH STRESS
Emotional support of children is
very important during a disaster.
If not addressed, a child's fears
may continue long after the
actual disaster has passed.
Young children are particularly
at risk during these times
because of their deep sense of
vulnerability, their lack of
understanding and their
difficulty in communicating how
they feel. Older children are
affected too. Like their younger
siblings, they might find it
difficult to express their feelings.
They may be terribly frightened
of how the disaster might affect
their future.
Fortunately, parents and other
adults can make a great
difference in how children deal
with stress. Your love and
support can carry children over
the rough spots. Initially, it helps
to recognize some normal
reactions that children may have
to disaster. From there, you can
take practical steps to foster
understanding and support.FEARS
It is normal for children to be afraid, especially with the uncertainty
brought by natural disasters like a flood or tornado. The fear may last for
an extended period of time and is best dealt with by kindness and
understanding on the part of parents. Children should be encouraged to talk
about their feelings and express their fears through play, drawing, painting
or working with clay.
Children's fears vary according to age, maturity and previous learning
experience. Four major fears common in children are: death, darkness,
animals and abandonment. If they have experienced flooding, fire or
tornado, children may have encountered several of these fears.
Fears may be intensified when adults back away from discussing the topic
with children. Many families ban all painful topics from family
conversation. A better approach is to openly talk with your children about
their feelings.
WHAT YOU CAN DO
♦Talk with your child, providing simple, accurate information to
questions. This helps avoid the fear of the unknown.
♦Listen to what your child says and how your child says it. Is there
fear, anxiety, insecurity? Repeating the child's words may be very
helpful, such as “You are afraid that...” or “You wonder if the flood
will come again tonight?” This helps both you and the child clarify
feelings.
♦Make sure children know the family's difficulties are not their fault.
Children tend to blame themselves for problems.
♦Reassure your child with statements such as “We are together. We
care about you. We will take care of you.” You may need to repeat
information and reassurances many times.
♦Hold your child. Provide comfort. Touching is important for children
during this period. Close contact helps assure children that you are
there for them and will not abandon them.
♦Involve children. Let them help fill a sandbag or participate in a safe,
simple clean-up activity. This helps them feel they are part of the
family. It also helps them feel needed, appreciated and useful.
♦Spend extra time putting your child to bed. Talk and offer assurance.
Leave a night light on if that makes the child feel more secure.

child plays. Children frequently express feelings of fear or anger
while playing with dolls, trucks or friends after a major disaster.
♦Provide play experiences to relieve tension. Work with clay and paint;
play in water, etc. If children show a need to hit or kick, give them
something safe like a pillow, ball or balloon. Allow a safe, open
space for them to play if possible. If your child lost a meaningful toy
or blanket, allow the child to mourn and grieve (by crying, perhaps).
In time, it may be helpful to replace the lost object.
♦Contact a community resource such as your doctor, mental health
agency or minister if you sense you need outside help for a child.
♦Keep your sense of humor and enjoy a good laugh together
frequently.
♦Take care of your own emotions and stress. Children will reflect your
anxiety or your calm.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionHiring a Contractor After a Disaster
LOCATING QUALIFIED PEOPLE AND AVOIDING FRAUD
If your home has been damaged
by a natural disaster, you are
probably eager to have repairs
made. But it is well worth your
time to find a reliable contractor
for the job. Most people start by
asking friends, neighbors and
colleagues for
recommendations. Hardware
stores, lumberyards, insurance
agents and lending institutions
may be able to recommend
contractors as well. If your
community is receiving disaster
assistance, check with agency
personnel for lists of
contractors.
Always get a written contract for
repairs, but don't be pressured
to hurriedly sign it. Ask for
references and check them out.
If sub-contractors will be used,
do the same.GENERAL CONTRACTOR OR SPECIALIST?
If you need a variety of repairs, you may want to hire a general, building
or remodeling contractor to coordinate the project. You sign one contract
and the contractor arranges all the work, subcontracting with various
specialists — like plumbers, masons or electricians.
Specialists often are available to work on a single type of repair such as:
concrete, masonry, carpentry, drywall, insulation, painting, floor coverings,
electrical work, plumbing, heating, roofing, siding, waterproofing, and fire
and flood restoration.
DO YOUR HOMEWORK
When it comes to home repair, it's important to understand the options you
have, as well as some of the terms contractors use. Some good sources of
information include your county Extension office, disaster assistance
center, lumberyard or local librarian. Also think about any home
improvements that might be combined with repairs, such as modifications
to increase energy efficiency or sump pump installation to prevent future
basement flooding.
INTERVIEWING CONTRACTORS
Be prepared to have contractors approach you after a disaster. Make sure
they are legitimate business persons. Are they registered with county
authorities? Do they have a business card, brochure, letterhead and
telephone number? Ask if they belong to any trade associations. For
plumbers and electricians, ask to see their state license.
Write down a list of questions you want to ask each prospective contractor
and interview at least three. Some possible questions include:
♦Does the contractor have a good reputation? Ask for references from
previous jobs and if you can see examples of past work. Ask where
he or she plans to purchase materials and contact the supplier to see if
bills are paid on time. Call the local building inspector, Better
Business Bureau, Home Builders Association, Building Trade Council
or chamber of commerce to see if any complaints have been filed
against the contractor.
♦Does the contractor have appropriate insurance? Contractors should
have liability insurance and workers' compensation insurance. If not,
you may be liable for accidents on your property. Ask the contractor
for proof of current insurance coverage.
University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative Extension COMMUNITY /FAMILYISSUES-REBUILDING

If problems arise with a
contract:
1) Try to resolve them directly
with the contractor. Do this in
writing so you both have a

problems, contact the
Consumer Protection Office
for Wisconsin at (800)
422-7128 or the Better
Business Bureau at (800)
273-1002;
3) Contact the contractor's

written estimate. The estimate usually will be in the form of a contract
you can sign to hire the contractor. When comparing estimates, be sure
that all bids are based on the same work. And if you plan to do some of
the restoration work yourself, be sure to check with the contractor to see
how this will affect warranties and the schedule.
Remember, the lowest bid is not always the best one. There may be a
misunderstanding of the nature of the work being quoted, a mistake in the
quote, poor quality workmanship being offered or use of low-grade materials.
QUESTIONS TO ASK REFERENCES
Call at least two contractor references. Here are a few questions to ask:
♦Why did you decide to use this contractor?
♦What work was done for you? Was it completed on time?
♦Are you happy with the finished product?
♦Did the workers keep the project area neat and clean?
♦Was the work completed at the price stated in the contract?
♦Would you hire this contractor again?
CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS
Get a written contract. Oral contracts can't always be enforced.
♦Include the building plans and/or specifications in the contract.
♦Specify the start and finish dates to protect your interests, but realize that
bad weather, unavailable materials or other problems may affect these
dates.
♦Include pay schedules for the work and itemized prices for the work. If
you want special materials — for example, hardwood trim or top grade
lumber — be sure this is specified.
♦If possible, have a lawyer review all contracts and related documents
before you sign.
♦Don't make a large first payment, and don't pay for the project in full
until work has been completed and inspected.
♦Clearly state any warranties or guarantees on the work.
♦Be sure both you and the contractor sign the agreement, with each of you
keeping original copies.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionSite Selection When Building
HOW TO AVOID GROUNDWATER FLOODING
Groundwater flooding in homes
is a common seasonal nuisance.
Floors and walls may get wet,
resulting in minor damages. In
heavy rainfall years, high
groundwater can become a
much more serious and
widespread concern as more
homes are affected and the
damage is greater.
The best time to think about
groundwater flooding is before
land is purchased or a home is
built. Any site should be
examined carefully to determine
the potential for groundwater
problems. If you have already
selected a site with potential
groundwater problems, you can
ward off trouble with various
construction modifications.ASSESSING THE LAND
Get input from experts in the area of soils and groundwater when
evaluating property for possible construction. Some good resources include
county planning and zoning offices, the Soil Conservation Service,
contractors with groundwater expertise, well drilling companies and
UW-Extension offices.
A number of natural features of the land can be examined to determine
whether the site is suitable for building:
♦Topography. The land surface on and around the proposed building
site can offer evidence of potential for groundwater flooding.
a) Flat landscapes often have shallow depths to water tables,
particularly in floodplains of rivers, streams or areas with
numerous wetland features. When these areas are subject to
extended surface water flooding, they also may experience
flooding from rising groundwater.
b) Hilly terrains do not guarantee freedom from groundwater
problems. Depending on the nature of the bedrock underlying the
soils and the characteristics of the soils, groundwater can be close
to the surface on some slope locations. Seeps may form on slopes
or near the base of slopes as the water table contacts the surface.
♦Vegetation on or near a prospective building site can offer significant
clues about the prevailing conditions of soil moisture and potential for
groundwater problems. Some native trees such as black willow, black
ash, silver maple, red maple, cottonwood, swamp white oak, white
cedar and balsam fir are very tolerant of wet soils. Even if the
property is not considered a wetland, the presence of pockets of
wetland plants such as dogwood, viburnum or alder shrubs, and
herbaceous species such as cattails, reed canary grass or bulrushes
near the elevation of the building site may indicate high groundwater.
♦Soil characteristics offer an opportunity to confirm suspected
groundwater problems. Digging a soil pit to look at the soil profile
can reveal evidence of maximum groundwater levels that may be well
above the average position of the water table. Since basement
excavations are typically in the 5- to 6-foot range, soil pits may not
be practical without special equipment or the use of a contractor. Or,
you might seek help from a soils expert.

Perhaps you have already made a decision to build on a site with potential
groundwater problems. Or perhaps potential problems became apparent
after excavating began. Groundwater trouble still could be avoided by
using several construction modifications.
♦House construction can be modified or designed to reduce the risk of
groundwater flooding on a site.
a) One option is to reduce the depth of the excavation for location of
footings. Fill is then added to the landscape to elevate the
basement (or slab floor) above the anticipated maximum water
table or groundwater level.
b) Your contractor may recommend additional drain tile against the
footings and basement walls. Drain tile may also be placed under
the basement floor; the tile will facilitate drainage down a slope or
accommodate a sump pump to relieve water pressure.
c) The house design may be altered to minimize the need for full
basement construction. This alternative requires less backfill to be
hauled in to elevate the house. One design option, for example, is
to use a bilevel or split level design, which does not require a
fully excavated basement.
♦The septic system can be located and designed to reduce the chance
of premature contact of septic waters with groundwater. While testing
of soils and percolation rates is required to obtain septic system
permits, testing does not guarantee that a site will be free of
groundwater flooding. The construction of mound systems in areas
known or suspected of potential groundwater problems can be an
option or requirement.
♦Well location should take into account the probable direction of
groundwater flow. This reduces the risk of having the well positioned
“downstream” from the septic system or neighboring septic systems in
the event of contact between septic drain fields and groundwater.
Well casings can be positioned to reduce the risk of contaminated
groundwater or ponded surface waters entering the well.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionErosion Control When Building or Rebuilding
CONTROL PRACTICES FOR HOME SITES
If you are building or rebuilding
following a disaster, make sure
you and your builder are in
compliance with local, county
and state erosion control
ordinances.
Erosion control is important
because eroding construction
sites are a leading cause of
water quality problems in
Wisconsin. Unless a builder
uses erosion controls, about a
dump truck and a half of soil
washes into a nearby lake or
stream for every acre under
construction. The sediment
problems eventually lead to
higher taxes for waterway
dredging and clean-up of
streets, sewers and ditches;
lowered property values for
areas with sediment-damaged
lakes or streams; poor fishing
from muddy waterways; and
nuisance growth of weeds and
algae.
Except for new one- and
two-family dwellings, local
ordinances may be more strict
than those from the Wisconsin
Department of Industry, Labor
and Human Relations (DILHR).
They may also require erosion
control on construction projects
not affected by state or federal
regulations.EROSION CONTROL PLANS
The DILHR Uniform Dwelling Code is enforced for one- and two- family
dwellings in most communities. The code requires that an erosion control
plan be submitted with the building permit application to the local building
inspector.
The erosion control plan must show:
♦Location of the dwelling, other buildings, wells, surface waters and
disposal systems on the site with respect to property lines.
♦Direction of all slopes on the site.
♦Location and type of erosion control measures.
CONTROLS REQUIRED
Erosion control is important even for home sites of an acre or less. The
materials needed are easy to find and relatively inexpensive — straw bales
or silt fence, stakes, stone, plastic tubes and grass seed. Additional controls
may be needed for sites that have steep slopes, are adjacent to lakes and
streams, receive a lot of runoff from adjacent land, or are larger than an
acre.
Only a few controls are needed on most sites:
♦Preserving existing trees and grass where possible to prevent erosion.
♦Silt fence or straw bales to trap sediment on the downslope sides of
the lot.
♦Stone drive used by all vehicles to limit tracking of mud onto streets.
♦Clean-up of sediment carried off-site by vehicles or storms.
♦Downspout extenders to prevent erosion from roof runoff.
♦Revegetating the site as soon as possible.
MAINTENANCE AND WASTE DISPOSAL
♦Sediment controls must be maintained until the site is stabilized by
mulching and seeding, sodding or landscaping.
♦All building waste must be properly disposed to prevent pollutants
and debris from being carried off-site.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionDisaster Response
PRIORITIES AND RESOURCES FOR COMMUNITIES
Communities can either come
together or unravel after a
disaster. The difference is often
the degree of focus,
coordina-tion and
communication among residents
and leaders.
It helps if communities identify
priorities for emergency
response before a disaster
occurs. Local government
should be familiar with
emergency resources within the
community and what is available
on local, state and national
levels.CONCERNS FOLLOWING IMPACT
Usually the most critical concerns following disaster impact include:
♦Rescue of injured or endangered residents, removal of victims,
evacuation
♦Downed electric wires, power outages
♦Leaking gas mains, ruptured chemical containers
♦Containing and extinguishing fires
♦Prevention of looting
RESPONSE RESOURCES
Beyond local government and emergency services such as police and fire
departments, communities can look for assistance from the following
resources:
♦Local emergency government. Every county in Wisconsin is required
by state statute to have an emergency government office and director
in place. While larger cities may have local directors, smaller
communities often have a critical need for the leadership and direction
county emergency government can offer.
♦The American Red Cross. Providing food and shelter to disaster
survivors is a major thrust of Red Cross assistance, but assistance can
also extend to back-up medical services, especially in smaller
communities.
♦The state highway department may be called in for rerouting of traffic
and related concerns.
♦The National Guard may be called in to prevent looting, help with
sandbagging in a flood or any number of other measures involving
manpower.
♦Declarations from the president. Once a preliminary damage
assessment has been completed by emergency response personnel, the
state governor can request a major disaster or emergency declaration
from the President of the United States:
a) Declaration of an Emergency - The president can issue this
declaration to supplement state and local effort to save lives and
protect property. Total assistance provided may not exceed $5
million.

assistance is offered to both public and private sectors through the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Nearly 100
different programs and services help provide disaster relief.
OTHER RESPONSE CONCERNS
Once rescue concerns and other immediate dangers are taken care of,
another level of activity needs to take place. Sometimes these concerns
must be addressed upon impact.
♦Is the water safe to drink? Testing for safe water should begin and
continue throughout disaster recovery because of the chance of
contamination from many different sources.
♦Sewers.Chemical spillage needs immediate attention to prevent
problems at the sewage treatment plant. In some cases the plant may
be overloaded because of floodwaters.
♦Structural safety. Are buildings and homes safe to enter? Professional
building inspection is critical.
♦Hazardous materials. All hazardous materials stored at commercial
and other properties should be accounted for, from industrial
chemicals to those used at drycleaners and gas stations. Spills can be
a problem, and pressurized tanks could burst. Fire departments are
required to keep an inventory of hazardous material locations.
♦Damaged trees, debris. Debris is a major cause of injury during
clean-up. Machinery should be brought in to help clear and dispose of
wreckage. Some communities have brought in metal removers after a
tornado to adequately clear farm fields for safe tractor use.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionGetting Local Government Back on Track
MEETING OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES AFTER A DISASTER
When disaster strikes a
community, government leaders
are under intense pressure to
stay on top of recovery issues.
Residents, business,
government units and the media
want answers and direction,
even if emergency government
has taken the reigns on
emergency response efforts. If
local leaders are among those
affected by the disaster, getting
government back on track can
be especially difficult. But use of
all available expertise and
resources can ease the situation.GENERAL GUIDELINES
♦Recognize there is often a delicate balance between emergency
government and local government. While emergency government has
statutory authority for response efforts after a disaster, disagreements
and resentments can occur unless there is cooperation, trust and
ongoing communication between local and emergency officials. This
is also true during the recovery phase, when the community has
ultimate authority, but other agencies are still involved.
♦Discuss your community's recovery needs with state and U.S.
representatives. They can be a great asset in obtaining disaster
assistance on the state and national levels. Recognize that you may be
competing with other communities across the nation for assistance.
♦Take advantage of all available expertise and resources. Your
community will need help on a continuing basis for a long time after
a disaster. Cooperative Extension specialists in the area of community
resources can often help local leaders see the “big picture,” find their
way through the government maze, and utilize every available
resource. These resources may include:
a) local emergency government
b) Cooperative Extension agents, including county agents and
specialists from throughout the state
c) state agencies, such as the Department of Natural Resources, the
Department of Development and Department of Transportation
d) the National Guard
e) the Federal Emergency Management Agency
f) the American Red Cross, the Salvation Army, churches and
volunteer groups
g) regional planning commissions
h) temporary employees. Limited-term employees can be of great
help to communities in the months following a disaster. Funding
is often available through state or federal disaster relief agencies.
♦Balance the pressure to speed recovery with the need for planning
and new growth within a community. Getting local government back
on track may mean new efforts to:
a) Provide business counseling to local merchants that have sustained
damage. The rebuilding period is an excellent time to re-evaluate
business and make necessary improvements or changes in focus.
Economic recovery can go hand in hand with disaster recovery.
University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative Extension COMMUNITY /FAMILYISSUES-COMMUNITY RECOVERY

Your local emergency government
office, your county community resource
and development agent, the American
Red Cross, the Federal Emergency
Management Agencyb) Consider land-use and zoning changes that are long overdue.
c) Address aesthetic issues as business and residents begin
rebuilding. These may cover architectural styles, colors, textures,
size and height restrictions, and signage.
♦Don't ignore your own needs. It's critical to keep a balance between
your public duty and your personal life — especially if your home
and family have been affected by disaster. It's not uncommon for
leaders to spend all their time coordinating disaster efforts only to
resign shortly afterward because they neglected their own concerns.
WORKING WITH THE PUBLIC
Community meetings can be an excellent way to get everyone moving in
the same direction. However, it's better to hold meetings after the
emergency response phase has passed and the community is out of danger.
That way people can more calmly focus on recovery, clean-up efforts and
their future. During the emergency phase, people need basic information
about shelter, medical assistance, food and disaster relief. Radio and
television announcements and relief workers can usually do the job most
efficiently.
Drop-in centers for information on disaster relief are another good idea.
Communities can use a municipal building, school, library or other public
building to dispense information on everything from temporary housing
and disaster loans to water-damaged basements. Relief agency
representa-tives can be available to residents daily or weekly. Local
officials should also be available on a regular basis to meet with residents.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionPlanning and Zoning After a Disaster
IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE LONG-TERM
Following a disaster, residents
and business owners will be
anxious to rebuild and in some
cases relocate. This is a critical
time for local government to
assess issues of land use in
terms of safety and long-term
development concerns. Smaller
communities may not have
land-use plans or zoning
ordinances. Training and
assistance is often needed to
begin using these tools after a
disaster.
Larger communities usually have
land-use plans and zoning
ordinances, but they may need
to be updated to reflect
changing circumstances. And
communities of all sizes may
need assistance in handling the
sudden surge in zoning permits
and land-use proposals.
Additional resources:
Your local emergency government
office, your county community resource
and development agent, the American
Red Cross, the Federal Emergency
Management AgencyIMMEDIATE CONCERNS
♦While local government needs to act quickly on issues of planning
and zoning after a disaster, the long-term impact of each decision
must be taken into account. This is an important principle to
remember and discuss at public meetings when emotions are running
high.
♦Land-use plans and zoning ordinances are especially useful if there
has been a great deal of destruction. They can provide the community
with a blueprint for the future.
♦Regional planning commissions or county zoning departments often
can help train local officials in setting up land-use and zoning review
boards.
♦If a land-use plan exists, check to see that it is up to date. Check
building codes, subdivision ordinances and ordinances on land-use
and building. Communities with an office of planning or zoning may
need to hire temporary staffing to help with an increased number of
requests.
CONCERNS DURING THE REVIEW PROCESS
♦Look for existing land-use conflicts. Examples might include machine
shops within neighborhoods, bars next to churches or schools, and
dangerous chemical suppliers or high-truck traffic in a downtown.
♦Be wary of proposals that cause new land-use conflicts.
♦Recognize there is a tendency to restore things immediately to the
“way they were” without an eye to what makes sound, attractive
community development.
♦Special considerations need to be taken for properties located in flood
zones. Communities may need to rezone areas, buy properties or use
condemnation procedures. Sometimes rezoning a property to a
“non-conforming use” can be helpful. This usually prohibits additions
to property or repairs that are more than half the assessment value of
homes.
Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension
University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative Extension COMMUNITY /FAMILYISSUES-COMMUNITY RECOVERYAesthetics and Design Ordinances
HELPING GUIDE THE LOOK OF THINGS TO COME
A community will never look
quite the same after a major
disaster. Beautiful old trees may
be lost forever. Some
neighborhoods get facelifts,
others may drift apart.
Storefronts and cityscapes
change. People are anxious to
restore things to order, even if
it's not possible to turn back the
clock. The trouble is, hasty
recovery efforts can leave a
community with a hodgepodge
appearance that no one ever
intended. Worse yet,
communities that weren't
well-planned in the first place
are sometimes all too successful
in recreating the old look.
Design ordinances with a
concern for appearance can
make the difference. With them,
you can help ensure that new
and renovated structures are
compatible with existing
architecture. The purpose is not
to lay down a long list of
restrictions, but to help avoid
potential eyesores or structures
not in keeping with the character
of an area. Typical concerns
covered by ordinances include
architectural style, texture and
color, size and height, and
signage.GETTING SET UP
Try to set up a design review committee, if you don't already have one,
early on in the recovery phase. From there you can discuss aesthetics
concerns and how they can be reflected in design ordinances.
Committee training is important. You need smooth operations and review
procedures to inspire confidence from fellow citizens. Help and expertise
can come from your Extension community development agents, county
planning agencies, private consultants and your regional plan commission.
Committee members may be appointed from local representatives of
government, but it's often a good idea to appoint citizen members as well.
♦Begin with the notion that what's being built today in your community
will last 70, 80 or 100 years. With that in mind, aesthetics become a
weighty issue. This is a good time to discuss an existing or potential
community theme.
♦Try to build up and/or reflect community pride in your discussions
and actions. Is the community known for its historical architecture,
natural beauty, waterways, ethnic heritage, recreation, manufacturing
history, or small town feel? What's important to the look or the
character of place?
♦Guard against a sterile look. It's easy to forget that the charm of older
homes and buildings is often their multiple textures — the brick,
wood, glass and surrounding trees and vegetation. Metal pole-frame
buildings, new siding and strip malls may go up fast, but they won't
generate the same warmth or interest.
♦If historic preservation is a concern, get assistance from groups like
the Wisconsin Trust for Historic Preservation and the State Historical
Society. Remember that historic preservation extends to rural
structures, including historically significant barns and outbuildings.
MAKING A CASE FOR AESTHETICS
Educating the public about aesthetic concerns is a major part of the
committee's work. When people hear the words “design ordinances,” they
may have fears about radical changes in the wind.
♦Expect resistance through the review process. Meet it by listening to
fears and concerns, and negotiating win-win solutions whenever
possible.

UW-Extension publication “Community
Growth Policy — Economic Impacts of
Growth and Local Policy Choices,”
(NCR079).♦Try to use drawings, models and slides of what the community (or
area of reconstruction) can look like. Consultants regularly provide
these, but sometimes government planning agencies can assist as well.
♦Realize that people take for granted that aesthetics will be the same
when the community has recovered.
♦Discourage incompatible mixes of architecture or building uses. At
the same time, help businesses think about aesthetics and their image
in the community. If businesses need to remodel or relocate, help
them in their efforts; make them part of the big picture.
♦Realize that you can't be too strict or people will have trouble with
ordinances. Rejecting gaudy paint colors is one thing; specifying a
palette of permissible colors may be a bit extreme for many
communities.
♦Be aware of typical aesthetic problems following a disaster:
a) Temporary structures such as pole-frame barns or trailers can
become permanent structures if communities aren't vigilant.
b) Some people, including those on design review committees, rally
around themes that may not be appropriate for a community.
Choosing an ethnic or other unifying theme is a major decision
that needs support from the community to be a success. What has
worked in one community may not work for another.
♦If the disaster was a major historical event for your community,
consider ways of commemorating the disaster and those touched by it.
You might incorporate a public display, memorial or cornerstone into
a public building, park or other space. Such symbolic structures can
be very powerful to a community's identity and emotional recovery.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionEconomic Development When Rebuilding
FOSTERING GROWTH AFTER A DISASTER
Communities should take a good
look at economic development
goals after a disaster. For
various reasons, the time is ripe
for planning. Building and
relocation activity may be
occurring at an unprecedented
rate during recovery efforts.
Business and private individuals
may have available cash from
property and insurance checks.
Industry and businesses that
were only marginally profitable
before the disaster face major
decisions about staying in
business, relocating or changing
direction.
To guide positive economic
growth, communities should
have economic development
plans in place. Now is the time
to review plans and update them
as necessary. Small
communities without such plans
can get assistance from county
development corporations or
regional planning commissions.
In addition to planning for
private growth, communities
need to be farsighted about
public property replacement and
improvements.WHERE DO WE WANT TO BE?
Economic development is a process guided by both planning and
unforeseen events, such as business closures, new industry or disasters.
Communities need to assess current economic development conditions
when disaster strikes. But they also need to ask, “Where do we want to be
five, 10 and 25 years from now?” And “How do our decisions and
assistance today affect the outcome?” Here are two guidelines to keep in
mind:
♦Reassess economic conditions and existing development plans.
Discuss the history and direction of your community as you review
public policy related to economic development. Re-evaluate economic
development plans currently on the books — they may not reflect
current goals or changed circumstances because of destruction.
♦If your community has no economic development plan in place, get
assistance. Don't work in a vacuum. Contact your local Extension
office, your county development corporation or regional planning
commission. All can offer expertise on retaining, expanding and
attracting business and industry to your community.
REBUILDING GUIDELINES
♦Make sure you are not rebuilding mistakes. Examine areas affected by
disaster and consider how they fit into current economic development
goals. Some industries may need to relocate to new or existing
industrial parks. Likewise, some businesses may be better suited to
business parks or other areas. Consider existing and potential traffic
patterns. In some cases, roads may need to be rebuilt to suit changing
needs.
♦Help local business and industry take advantage of disaster relief
sources.These may include private insurance, low-interest loan
programs, grants and business counseling.
a) Small business that was struggling to stay afloat before the
disaster often can benefit from Small Business Development
Center assistance. Business plans can be reviewed for viability and
new plans established. Because businesses may have insurance
checks in hand, this is an excellent time to consider improvements
in retail space, location, production facilities and marketing.

to streamline recovery efforts, including approval processes, and
provision of utilities, transportation and communication.
♦Encourage timely rebuilding where feasible. Remember that your
community may lose tax revenue from structures that are not rebuilt
within the year.
♦Keep disaster preparedness and mitigation in mind as rebuilding
begins.Some structures may need to be flood-proofed, raised or
relocated. Tornado shelters and expanded warning systems are typical
improvements after tornadoes. Fire prevention should be a concern as
any structures are rebuilt.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionCaring for Flooded Lawns
DAMAGE ASSESSMENT AND RESTORATION
Lawns usually survive being
underwater for up to four days.
But you may have to replace the
lawn if floodwaters caused
erosion or brought chemicals,
contaminants or more than an
inch of mud or silt.
Your major concern this growing
season should be stabilizing the
soil to prevent further sediment
movement. Planting a temporary
lawn is usually the best way to
do this. Next year you can
establish permanent grasses.
While floodwater may cause new
weed problems, keep in mind
that some weed cover is better
than no cover. Weeds help dry
out soil.WHEN THE LAWN IS UNDERWATER
Damage to your lawn will depend on many factors including duration of
submergence, water depth, temperature, grass species, light intensity and
condition of the grass prior to flooding. A few general rules:
♦Grasses survive much longer at water temperatures below 60 degrees
F. than at higher temperatures. But most grasses survive submergence
at normal summer temperatures.
♦Tolerance to submergence varies among grasses in the Midwest.
Bentgrass has excellent tolerance, while Kentucky bluegrass, tall
fescue and rough bluegrass have intermediate tolerance. Fineleaf
fescue and perennial ryegrass generally have poor tolerance.
♦As soon as possible after the water recedes, aerate the soil to a depth
of at least three inches and lightly fertilize flooded areas. You can
rent a mechanical aerator from your lawn and garden store or use a
pitchfork. Areas submerged longer than four to six days may not
survive and will require complete re-establishment (see steps in
section on heavy silt deposits below).
DEALING WITH AN INCH OF SILT
Lawns submerged for less than four days and covered with an inch of silt
or less have a good chance of recovery. To assist recovery:
♦Wash as much silt as possible from the lawn using a garden hose.
♦Use a steel tooth garden rake, a mechanical aerator or spiking
equipment to break up the silt crust. Keep it broken throughout the
growing season or until grass has become well established.
♦Collect a representative soil sample and have it tested by your county
Extension office for nitrogen, lime, phosphorous and potassium
requirements. Agents can make recommendations on fertilizer and
nutrients.
♦If lawn recovery is spotty or generally thin, mechanically aerate the
lawn four to six times in late summer or early spring. Then overseed
with a desirable permanent seed mixture.
University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative Extension COMMUNITY /FAMILYISSUES-TREE/LAWNRECOVERY
more informationHANDLING EROSION
If your lawn's topsoil has been
greatly eroded, replace it to a
depth of 4 to 6 inches late in the
growing season. If topsoil is
unavailable or too expensive,
you can improve existing soil by
adding organic matter such as
peat, rotted sawdust, manure or
other materials. Apply these
materials at a rate of 3 cubic
yards per 1,000 square feet of
lawn area and work them into
the top 4 inches of subsoil. A
temporary lawn, established
immediately and later worked
into the subsoil, can also be a
source of organic matter.

“Sampling Lawn and Garden Soils for
Soil Testing,” (A2166).DEALING WITH HEAVY SILT DEPOSITS
Lawns covered with more than an inch of silt may be heavily damaged,
with only a slight chance of recovery. The degree of recovery will vary
with grass species and depth of silt.
Re-establish the lawn as follows:
♦If silt accumulation exceeds 3 inches, consider having silt removed
professionally. However, it may be more practical to rototill the area,
using the silt layer as a new topsoil and having it tested for nutrients.
♦If silt is less than 3 inches, or has been removed to this depth, till the
area, making sure the silt is mixed thoroughly and uniformly through
the top 4 inches of the original soil.
♦Take a soil sample of the new soil mixture after silt has been mixed
in. Have the mixture tested to determine lime, phosphate and potash
requirements.
♦Retill after applying lime and fertilizer according to soil test
recommendations.
♦Reseed the area as you would to establish a new lawn. Seedings,
especially of cool season grasses, should be made in early spring or
late summer.
ESTABLISHING TEMPORARY LAWNS
♦Where lawns must be completely re-established and immediate cover
is needed, scratch the soil surface with a hand rake or similar tillage
tool.
♦Seed annual ryegrass at a rate of 4 to 6 pounds per 1,000 square feet.
♦Till the ryegrass under at the appropriate time for re-establishment.
Seed permanent grasses.
OIL AND CHEMICAL SPILLS
Soils may have been saturated with oil, herbicides or other toxic material.
Petroleum will eventually decompose, but nothing can be done in the
meantime to cancel its harmful effects. On large areas, bury oil deposits by
deep plowing. On small areas, remove petroleum-soaked soil to a depth of
6 inches, and replace with new topsoil. Have a soil test taken; lime can
often be added as a neutralizer. Reseed at the appropriate time.

University of Wisconsin-Extension • Cooperative ExtensionSolid Waste and Contamination Concerns
GUIDELINES FOR COMMUNITIES AFTER A DISASTER
Solid waste management is
critical to communities after a
disaster. While the tendency is
to clear major areas of debris
first, identification and control of
hazardous materials should take
priority. Without these efforts,
human life and the environment
may be threatened. Potential
hazards include contamination
of public and private water
supplies, fire, explosions, toxic
releases into the atmosphere,
chemical contamination of
properties and waterways, and
direct exposure to unsuspecting
residents or emergency
response teams.HAZARDOUS DEBRIS
♦Notify local emergency government officials. Depending upon the
hazard potential of released materials, teams of trained hazardous
materials specialists may be called on site immediately. Control and
containment of hazardous materials will be the first priority.
Appropriate state and federal authorities should be notified as well.
♦Identify areas of hazardous materials and potential contamination.
Facility site plans are good sources of public information for any
public, agricultural or commercial facilities that house significant
quantities of hazardous substances. Required by the Emergency
Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986, these plans are
filed on-site and with the local fire department, Local Emergency
Planning Committee (LEPC) and State Emergency Response Board
(SERB). Plans identify community hazards ranging from underground
fuel tanks and pesticide storage areas to toxic cleaning solvents,
manufacturing wastes and explosives.
♦Evacuate any areas where hazardous materials may cause harm. If
necessary, rope off areas to keep people out and place warning signs
signifying the danger.
♦Contact appropriate state agencies, such as the Department of
Natural Resources and Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade
and Consumer Protection. They offer technical guidance on clean-up
regulations and options for managing hazardous materials. Options
may include landfilling, incineration or chemical treatment.
♦Segregate hazardous from nonhazardous substances in all levels of
clean-up. Stress the importance of segregating materials to residents
involved in home clean-up activities, as well as recovering businesses,
manufacturers and farmers. Consult state officials to determine local
hazardous material collection options.
NONHAZARDOUS DEBRIS
County landfills and other licensed solid waste disposal facilities are the
logical sites for nonhazardous solid waste after a disaster. However, in
some cases, special one-time disposal sites may be available for
commu-nities or individuals. This was the case for the community of
Barneveld, Wisconsin, following the 1984 tornado that caused major
destruction. A one-time disposal facility was established in a local quarry.

Wells that have been overtopped
by floodwater pose a number of
immediate dangers, from
electrical shock to serious
water-borne illnesses. Therefore,
do not turn on your pump after
flooding has occurred and do
not drink or wash with well
water. Your well and pump need
to be inspected after a flood.
Your well also needs to be
properly disinfected and its
water tested for safety.WELL AND PUMP INSPECTION
Swiftly moving floodwater can carry large debris that could loosen well
hardware, dislodge well construction materials or distort casing. Coarse
sediment in the floodwaters could erode pump components. In some cases,
floods may cause some wells to collapse. For all these reasons, you should
have professionals inspect your system.
♦Electrical system. Do not turn on the equipment until the wiring
system has been checked by a qualified electrician, well contractor or
pump contractor. If the pump's control box was submerged during the
flood, all electrical components must be cleaned and dry before
electrical service can be restored. Get assistance in turning the pump
on from the well or pump contractor.
♦Pump operation. All pumps and their electrical components may be
damaged by sediment and floodwater. The pump, including the valves
and gears, needs to be cleaned of silt and sand. If pumps are not
properly cleaned and lubricated they can burn out. Get assistance
from a well or pump contractor who can clean, repair and maintain
different types of pumps.
♦General cleaning of drilled, driven or bored wells. To avoid damage
to the well, have the contractor remove mud, silt and other debris
from around the well top. If excessive mud, silt or sediment has
entered the well, the pump may need to be removed before cleaning
can take place.
♦Dug wells. Do not attempt to disinfect or use a dug well that has been
flooded.
PUMPING THE WELL
After the contractor services and cleans the well, pump it until the water
runs clear to rid the well of floodwater. Depending on the size and depth
of the well and extent of contamination, pumping times will vary. If the
water does not run clear, get advice from the county or state health
department or Extension service.
EMERGENCY DISINFECTION
After flooding, a well must be disinfected to kill bacteria and other
potential disease-causing organisms. Wells that are less than 50 feet deep
may be contaminated even if there is no apparent flood damage. The
following steps apply to drilled, driven or bored wells only. Disinfection
should not be attempted for dug wells.

DNR publication, “Bacteriological
Contamination of Drinking Water.”♦Follow the instructions above for pumping the well.
♦Prepare a chlorine solution. Approximately 8 quarts of 5.25-percent
(or 5 quarts of 10 percent) chlorine bleach such as Hilex, Clorox, etc.,
should be mixed with 100 gallons of water. It is best to prepare more
solution than the amount of water standing in the well; if this amount
is unknown, the 100-gallon measure is a safe estimate. Most garbage
cans hold 30 gallons or more; therefore, filling three (clean) cans with
the solution is sufficient.
♦Pour or pump the solution in the well in one continuous flow. Attach
a hose to a faucet and, making certain the hose itself is clean, place
the other end of the hose into the well. Open the faucet and
recirculate the chlorinated water for one hour, washing down the
inside of the casing and pump piping. Faucets in your house should
be opened until you detect a chlorine smell, then close them.
♦Allow the chlorine solution to remain in the well and piping for at
least 24 hours, preferably longer. The system should then be purged
free of chlorine. Since it can disrupt a septic system, the chlorinated
water should be run outdoors, perhaps into a ditch. It may kill grass
and shrubs, and should not be run into a lake or stream.
SAMPLING AND TESTING
Once all flooded wells have been disinfected, wait one week to have the
water sampled and tested by a state-certified laboratory or health
department. Do not drink the water until two consecutive tests come back
safe.
♦If the laboratory issues sterile bottles for sampling, carefully follow
all instructions for their use.
♦If the test comes back unsafe, redisinfect.
♦If the test comes back safe, retest in two weeks.
Unfortunately, your well may not be a safe source of water for months
after extensive flooding or high groundwater. Wastewater from
malfunctioning septic tanks or chemical seepage can contaminate the
groundwater even after water was tested and found to be safe. You need to
take long-range precautions, including repeated testing, to protect the safety
of drinking water. Keep in mind that even under normal conditions, all
private wells should be tested annually.

"Getting started with solar power   
 
By Sue Robishaw and Steve Schmeck   
www.manytracks.com   
 
Revised and updated from original article printed i n the May/June 1994, 78/3 issue.  
We call this ""The Homestead System"" because this is  how we, and so many others, 
started with solar electric. You can do it, too. Ge t your foot, or your whole self, into 
this circle called Alternative Energy. But be forewarn ed! Living ever closer to the Sun 
and the Wind and the Earth can be addictive. Here i s a way to start cutting yourself 
out of the game of destruction played by oil, gas, coal and nuclear industries. 
This is your basic photovoltaic system. How much usable e lectricity you get from this 
setup will depend on where you are located (both ge ographically and site 
specifically) and what Mother Nature is doing with the weather. You need sun to 
shine on your solar modules in order for that sun e nergy to be converted into 
electricity for you to utilize. Get out and look at  your site, track the sun's pattern, 
draw sun charts. Few sites are 100% great. You will  probably have to figure, think 
and compromise, but that is half the fun! 
There is a nifty device called the Solar Pathfinder  that can chart your site for direct 
sun for every month of the year (SolarPathfinder, 3 680 Hwy. 438, Pleasantville, TN 
37147, 931-593-3552, pathfinder@mlec.net, www.solar pathfinder.com). It's a great 
way to find that certain spot with the best solar g ain. Check with local alternative 
energy dealers-many offer a site survey service. Or  you can make your own sun 
chart. See The Passive Solar Energy Book by Edward Mazria, Rodale Press (1979) 
for detailed instructions. Or just observe your own  particular site over a year's time. 
Generally, the closer to your home (and the batteri es) you can place your panels, 
the better. The farther away you get, the more expe nsive it's going to be, because 
you'll need larger wire or more equipment. This art icle is an overview of a small, 
simple system. 
This is not a project you can do from your armchair , you have to get involved. So get 
as much information as you need to install your sys tem (or help someone else inst all 
your system) safely. Talk with dealers and users in  your area. Check out Home 
Power magazine (www.homepower.com, PO Box 520, Ashl and, OR 97520). Dealer 
catalogs/design guides can also be a good source of  information. The heart of the system 
So what might your system include? 
The heart of the system is the 
batteries. If you want to know how 
long someone has been involved in 
renewable energy (RE) ask them how 
they started. You are likely to get a 
variation on the tale of ""Well, I had an 
old car battery and wired it up to run a 
few tail light bulbs for lights and a 
radio. When it ran down I'd jury rig it 
up to my truck and charge it up while I 
ran into town""...or, ""I'd haul my battery 
over to a neighbor's house to charge it up."" And si nce the battery usually wasn't 
intended for this type of use, it would soon die an d another old battery scrounged up 
to put into service. 
We started that way, though we used the 12 volt mar ine deep cycle battery. They 
last longer than a regular car battery, but are sti ll not the best, no matter what their 
name, or advertising, suggests. 
Some lucky (smart) people start right off with a go od home system battery-the golf 
cart battery. Readily available and recyclable, the y are relatively inexpensive. With 
good care they can last five to eight years, and th ey can limp along much longer 
than that when necessary. They are six volt batteri es, so you need two (or sets of 
two) for your 12 volt system. (Ed. note: Regular ca r batteries are 12 volt, for those 
who don't know.) One set will give you a 220 amp ho ur battery bank for about $170. 
To help the batteries to a good, long life, plan on  not using more than 50% of that 
capacity. So for this system we can plan on 110 amp  hours of usable energy from 
the two golf cart batteries. 
The best bet for battery housing is a place above f reezing temperature and close to 
where you will be using the electricity. But- batteries can be dangerous. Just because 
they are common doesn't mean you should thoughtless ly stick them just anywhere. 
Batteries can explode, though, luckily, this isn't common. So build them their own 
place. A simple enclosed box can be made, with a ve nt to the outside (batteries give 
off small amounts of explosive gases when charging) . 
Also keep in mind that you want easy access to the batteries for checking the water 
levels and adding distilled water when needed. And keep a good supply of baking 
soda handy nearby ""just in case."" The baking soda w ill neutralize the battery acid in 
case of a spill. Learn how to take good care of you r batteries and they will respond 
by giving you longer service. 
The photovoltaic panel 
Now the showy part-your photovoltaic (PV) panels. T hey come in many brands and 
sizes, new and used, big and small. They each have their pluses and minuses but 
mostly one is as good as another. Today (2004) new panels come with a guarantee 
of at least 20 years. Used units can also be a good  option. But for our purposes here 
we'll go with one of the common modules sold, a She ll Solar, SQ80. The panel costs 
about $375 and  puts out 80 watts (4.5 amps) of power in full sun.  It is interesting that 
when we bought our first PV module back in 1981, th e cost was about the same, but 
 
Sue Robishaw and Steve Schmeck's off-grid home in 
Cooks, Michigan   its output was only 32 watts (2.2 amps). PV technol ogy has come a long way. 
PV rack or mount 
A solid rack to install your panel(s) on can be pur chased, but you can make one 
yourself fairly easily using readily available mate rials, either purchased or 
scrounged. You don't want to skimp here. This rack is holding quite an investment of 
your money (not to mention your power source). Your  rack can be set at one angle 
or be adjustable, be roof mounted or pole mounted. Your dealer should be able to 
give you help with a design. 
A simple control panel 
Your ""control panel"" for a system such as this can be fairly simple. A Schottky 
blocking diode between the panel and the batteries will prevent bleeding of your 
battery power back into the panels (and into the ni ght) when you are not charging. 
Cost: $10. You should have a disconnect, such as a 25 amp SPST switch ($7), 
between the panel and battery. Another disconnect s hould be installed between the 
battery and all loads, along with an automotive-typ e in-line 10 amp fuse. You will 
also want a minimum metering of at least an inexpen sive digital multi meter ($50 
from Radio Shack). You need to keep track of your b attery voltage to monitor how 
full, or empty, your batteries are powerwise. The m eter also comes in handy for 
various other checking and monitoring chores. 
Additional in-line meters are also nice to have, an d I'd recommend them if you can 
swing it. An analog amp meter (to monitor your powe r use) is about $20, and simple 
volt meters (analog, digital or LED) can be purchas ed for $20-$60. You can buy new 
meters, or maybe even used meters, from most altern ative energy  dealers. Or check 
out used units from Fair Radio Sales, PO Box 1105, Lima, OH 45820.  
Put your meters where they can be easily seen-not o nly for regular monitoring 
purposes, but for the meter reading mania that come s over folks with home power 
systems. 
The all important wire 
Wire is an essential, important, and sometimes over looked part of the system. 
Twelve volt systems require larger wire than 110 vo lt. There are plenty of wire charts 
around, and articles in Home Power and catalogs can  help you decide the size and 
wire to use. 
The main considerations are distance from one compo nent to another, system 
voltage, and amount of amperage running through the  wire. Whoever you buy your 
components from will be able to help you with this (if not, go elsewhere). For our 
simple system, we're going to put the panels within  40 feet of the batteries. We will 
size the wire to handle our anticipated future syst em of two modules (total of nine 
amps). So, 80 feet of #8 USE wire at about $50 shou ld do us. This wire will connect 
the panels to the battery. Battery interconnects (t o connect the two 6 volt batteries 
together to form a 12 volt battery) can be two gaug e, two cables for $15. For this 
system, lighter cables would do, but for the price we might as well go with the 
heavier wire and be prepared for future upgrades. Y ou will also need appropriately 
sized wire from the battery to the loads (such as l ights and radio). Now, there isn't much chance of overcharging your 2 20 amp hour battery bank with 
one 4.5 amp module if you're using the power now an d then, and monitoring it 
regularly. But if you'll be leaving the system for some time without using or 
monitoring it, then you'll want a charge controller  to prevent the PV module from 
overcharging your battery. This gets more important  as you add panels (and add 
additional charging capacity). A 4.5 amp charge con troller is about $35, a 12 amp 
charge controller (large enough for two modules) is  about $110. 
What will this system do?  
So what can you run with one or two PV modules? Tha t depends on your use. You 
can get a whole lot more hours of lighting if you u se efficient lights and turn them off 
when not in use, than if you have incandescent bulb s on all over the place. There is 
a very direct cause and effect here. A closet or pa ntry light that gets turned on and 
off often, but runs briefly, can be a low wattage i ncandescent light. A light that is on 
for an hour or more at a time should be a fluoresce nt or compact fluorescent. Lights 
needed for only minimal illumination such as an ent ryway or hallway can be very 
small amperage bulbs. Don't use any more light than  you need, and put it where you 
are going to use it.  
And, of course, turn it off when it's not needed. T his goes for any and all electric 
appliances. Conservation is the most important part  of the alternative energy 
system, or any energy system for that matter. If yo u don't use it, it doesn't have to be 
produced or transported in the first place. So spen d some time looking closely at 
your electrical use, and how you can reduce it. 
To give you an idea, we lived for 10 years on two p anels (older 2.2 amp models), 
running lights, radio/tape player, computer, printe r, and small tools. For many years 
we simply reduced our use in the short-sun days of winter and went back to candles 
and kerosene lamps for lighting. In the summer we h ad more than enough power. 
At some point we purchased a gasoline generator to run the washer and power 
tools. It also anemically served as a backup batter y charger in the winter. Then 
Steve made his own, much better, gasoline battery c harger using an old car 
alternator and the engine from our tiller. Several years later, we added two more 
used panels (of the same old model) so we then had about 8.8 amps of charging 
power in full sun. Our use also went up as we switc hed to run almost everything 
from the batteries. In the summer, we still had ple nty of power from our PV panels, 
but we continued to use our backup generator to cha rge up the batteries in the 
winter or during extensive cloudy weather.  
Eventually we ended up with 14 panels, all of the o lder 32 to 35 watt size, with a 
1200 watt battery bank and a large inverter. And ou r use grew as our system did. 
We still have extra power in the summer, but usuall y have to use the gas generator 
several times in November and December to help char ge the batteries. 
Inverters 
Which brings us to another option that you will wan t to consider for this system (the 
options are almost endless!). So far we've been tal king about a simple 12 volt 
system. That means all of your lighting, tools, and  appliances will need to be 12 volt. 
Unfortunately, 12 volt lights are more expensive th an 110 volt, and the tools and 
appliances are often inferior as well as more expen sive. We ran for years on 12 volt power, as have many oth er people. It is simple and 
straightforward, running lights, radio, computer, w asher and flour grinder. But if you 
want to run 110 volt appliances and lighting, you w ill need an inverter to change the 
12 volt DC power of the battery into the 120 volt A C power that those appliances 
require. The downside is that it is one more piece of equipment to buy and be 
dependent upon, but today's inverters are reliable enough to make this a reasonable 
option. We eventually switched everything in our ho use and shop to run off the 
inverter except for a few 12 volt lights and the fl our grinder. 
For most home power use you will want at least a mo dified square wave inverter. 
There are many brands, and they all have their pros  and cons and loyal users. 
Check out Home Power's reviews, talk with folks inv olved in the industry, and ask 
around for other's experiences. Intended use and pr ice will probably dictate which 
one you will want, as they are all readily availabl e. They come in all sizes and 
shapes. You can run your whole system on an inverte r, thereby being able to use 
commonly available appliances and smaller wiring. O r you can run a mainly 12 volt 
system, using your inverter just for specific uses.  
We started with a venerable old (and noisy) 250 wat t square wave TrippLite, but 
when the new small, inexpensive modified square wav e inverters became available, 
we were happy to change to a 100 watt Statpower uni t for computer, printers and 
small power tools. Then we made it to a 1300 watt P owerStar inverter to run 
vacuum, sewing machine and larger power tools. When  we got a laser printer, we 
had to add a 500 watt pure sine wave ExelTech. Some  things, like the laser printer, 
don't like modified sine wave so require pure sine wave inverters. Now we have a 
sine wave Trace 2500 that runs just about everythin g. But we still have and use the 
old Statpower 100 and PowerStar 1300. But do rememb er, an inverter does not 
produce more power, it just helps you use it. A Tra ce 2500 when we only had 2 or 4 
PV modules would have been rather pointless. We sim ply didn't have enough 
charging capacity then and would have had to run th e gas generator to charge the 
batteries to use the inverter to run the equipment.  Better to just run those tools 
directly from the gasoline generator until you get more PV charging capacity. 
But back to the realities of our small system. We'r e running a basic 12 volt operation, 
but will add a small inverter for small 110 volt us e. You can get a good 100 to 250 
watt inverter for $80 to $150. Inverters in the 400  to 800 watt range are around $100 
to $300. Check your 110 volt power use requirements  (read the labels) and size your 
inverter accordingly. 
Labeling 
Labeling-an extra, important, touch for your system . Do a lot of it. Make it easy. 
Make it readable. Do it for someone who has no idea  what your system is all about. 
Assume that someday, someone else will need to walk  into your home and be able 
to figure out your electrical system. And, of cours e, think it through and err on the 
margin of safety. Make sure everyone in the family understands at least the basics 
of the system, and how to run it. 
Cost and availability 
Total cost of the one module Homestead System, assu ming you are doing the work 
yourself, might be about $700. Where can you get th e equipment and more 
information? I've already mentioned Home Power maga zine, and COUNTRYSIDE 
articles, of course. Check out local sources. Ask a round. Many small dealers are on limited advertising budgets so you may have to do s ome legwork to ferret them out. 
Search out other users and ask where they purchased  their equipment and their 
experiences.  
Mail order and Internet suppliers are numerous. Sen d for catalogs, talk with them. 
Find a dealer who you are comfortable with, whether  local or long- distance, and stick 
with them. When you honestly add up the prices for the same components, including 
shipping and handling, you'll find little differenc e in the total price of a system among 
most dealers. A big consideration is service. This can be far and away more 
important than price. If you need help, you want to  have someone who is willing and 
able to give you needed advice. As is true with any  purchase, when it comes time to 
buy, it is up to us to decide who we want to suppor t. 
Another great source for A. E. information are the many regional energy fairs being 
held throughout the country. The largest is the Mid west Renewable Energy Fair in 
Custer, Wisconsin. Held the Summer Solstice weekend , this is a three day affair 
packed to overflowing with workshops, displays and events (and people!). There are 
many such events now across the country. 
The important thing is to get started however you c an, and have a good time doing 
it. If you are already hooked into the grid, consid er putting one small circuit on your 
own PV system. You'll have lights and radio when th e rest of your neighborhood is 
blacked out. You'll be able to feel good about the source of that power. If you are 
running now from a gasoline or propane generator, t hink how great it would be to 
turn on a light or listen to the radio without that  generator guzzling fuel and 
hammering away in the background. If you're running  a ""roving battery"" system, I 
don't need to tell you how great it would be not to  have to move that battery again. 
PV power is not costless, but it is quiet. And it i s available to anyone who wants to 
go that extra step to install a renewable energy, p hotovoltaic solar system. It will 
make you aware of the sun in a whole new way. 
The photovoltaic cell 
These silicon wafers are the heart of a solar panel . Semiconducting cells convert 
sunlight into electrical energy through the photovo ltaic process, hence the name. 
Like computer chips, the silicon in solar cells is made from highly refined sand. The 
wafers are layered with boron and phosphorus atoms before a metal coating is 
applied. 
The top side of the cell is painted with anti-refle ctive coating. This vastly increases 
the cell's ability to absorb sunlight. The cells ar e wired together in panels or modules 
for increased efficiency and energy output. Photons , which are bundles of energy 
from the light, strike the cell and provide enough power to dislodge the positively 
charged boron atoms and the negatively charged phos phorus atoms. When the cell 
is exposed to sunlight, these imbalanced electrons flow in an effort to equalize the 
balance. This activity creates an electrical curren t, which can be transferred to a 
power storage unit such as a battery.
